This vulnerable code simulates an uncontrolled resource consumption issue. It spawns several producer threads that continuously send messages via an unbounded mpsc channel without any backpressure mechanism. The atomic counter, updated inside an unsafe-conveyed routine, artificially tracks the load. When the load exceeds a fixed LIMIT, the producer panics—mimicking a denial-of-service (DoS) situation due to resource exhaustion. The unsafe raw pointer read in unsafe_transform further emphasizes risky low-level operations that mirror real-world vulnerabilities.
