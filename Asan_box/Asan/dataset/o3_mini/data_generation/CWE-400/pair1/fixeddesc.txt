In this corrected version, the Engine::run_input method enforces a maximum allowable input load.
If the load exceeds MAX_LOAD (set to 100), the function returns an error immediately, rather than
entering unsafe code that could deplete system resources. By performing this early validation, the design
introduces proper backpressure, thereby mitigating the risk of a denial-of-service attack.
