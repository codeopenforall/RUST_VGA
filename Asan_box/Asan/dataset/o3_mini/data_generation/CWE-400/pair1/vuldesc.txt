This version contains a critical flaw related to uncontrolled resource consumption.
Specifically, the Engine::run_input method does not restrict high load input values.
If an input greater than 100 is supplied, it proceeds to execute an unsafe block that intentionally
panics, simulating an unbounded resource consumption scenario (CWE-400). The lack of proper
backpressure or validation allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service directly.
