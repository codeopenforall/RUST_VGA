This code defines a ResourceManager that implements a Handler trait. Its process method spawns a new thread for every input element, each using an unsafe block to double the value. There is no backpressure or limit checking on the number of threads that may be spawned, which can be exploited to cause uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) when provided with a large input.
