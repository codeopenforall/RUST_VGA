This vulnerable code suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption flaw (CWE-400). The main computational function spawns one thread for every unit of the user-supplied input without enforcing any limit or backpressure mechanism. A malicious user can supply a very large number (e.g., 1_500 or greater) and force the program to create an excessive number of threads, potentially exhausting system resources such as memory or CPU scheduling, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
