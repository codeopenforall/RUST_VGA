This corrected implementation introduces an upper bound on the number of tasks by checking that the provided count does not exceed MAX_LIMIT (set to 1000). If it does, the function returns an error immediately, preventing any threads from being spawned and thereby avoiding excessive resource consumption. The underlying unsafe operations remain unchanged to simulate real-world low-level memory handling, but the overall DoS vulnerability is mitigated by enforcing proper limits.
