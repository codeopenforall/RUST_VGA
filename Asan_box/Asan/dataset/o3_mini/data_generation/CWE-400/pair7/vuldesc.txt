The vulnerability arises from an unbounded accumulation of incoming tasks in a global vector via unsafe access. Without any backpressure or resource limits, an adversary (or malformed input) can cause uncontrolled memory growth, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The use of unsafe blocks bypasses Rust’s safety checks, exposing the potential for resource exhaustion.
