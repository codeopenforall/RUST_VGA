This code implements a service that continuously ingests input data and appends each byte into a vector using an unsafe block. The function "simulate_input" does not perform any checks on the size of the vector, allowing an attacker to send a large amount of data, which could exhaust available memory or CPU resources (CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). As a result, a denial-of-service (DoS) condition is potentially reachable.
