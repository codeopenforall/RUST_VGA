The fixed code addresses the resource exhaustion vulnerability by replacing the unsafe unbounded vector with a Mutex-protected vector and enforcing an explicit upper limit on the number of tasks (max_tasks). In the add_task method, a check is performed before adding a new task, thereby preventing unbounded memory growth. This approach leverages Rust’s safe concurrency primitives and mitigates the DoS risk inherent in the original design.
