This code exhibits an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability (CWE-400). It spawns one thread for each task and unsafely appends a pointer to a global vector without enforcing any limits. In environments where input task counts are high, the unbounded thread creation and unchecked vector growth can exhaust CPU and memory resources. The use of unsafe block for direct pointer manipulation bypasses Rust's memory-safety guarantees, exacerbating the issue.
