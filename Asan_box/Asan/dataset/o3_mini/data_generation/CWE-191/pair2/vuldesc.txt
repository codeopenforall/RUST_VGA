This version simulates a real-world integer underflow vulnerability using unsafe blocks. Inside the decrease method, an unchecked subtraction (wrapping_sub) is performed without verifying whether the deduction exceeds the current value. In a concurrent context with multiple threads, if the deduction eventually exceeds the available value, the subtraction wraps around (underflows) leading to an incorrect, very large value. This mimics observed issues in real-world vulnerability reports such as those tracked by RustSec and CVE reports.
