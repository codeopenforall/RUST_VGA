The revised code replaces the unchecked subtraction with a saturating subtraction using the built-in
saturating_sub method. This ensures that if the subtraction would normally underflow, the value instead
saturates at 0. Hence, even when subtracting a value greater than the current, the computation remains safe.
All concurrency components and struct definitions remain intact, preserving the overall structure while
eliminating the integer underflow vulnerability (CWE-191).
