In this corrected version the withdrawal method verifies that the account balance is sufficient 
before subtracting the requested amount. This avoidance of unchecked arithmetic prevents 
an integer underflow. By returning an error when insufficient funds are present, the code 
ensures the account balance remains valid, even when accessed concurrently.
