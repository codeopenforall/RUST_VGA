In this corrected version the vulnerability is mitigated by adding an explicit bounds check before invoking the unsafe pointer arithmetic. The process_at method now verifies that the provided index is within the valid range of the underlying vector. Consequently, when an out-of-bound index is passed (e.g. 4 for a vector of length 4), the function returns an error ("Index out of bounds") instead of performing an unsafe memory read. Concurrency and smart pointer usage are retained, following realistic programming idioms.
