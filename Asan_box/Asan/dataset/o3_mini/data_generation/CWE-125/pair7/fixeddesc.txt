The corrected code addresses the vulnerability by replacing the unsafe unchecked access with a safe bounds-checked read. Specifically, the method 'fetch' now utilizes Vec::get followed by copying the value, which ensures that any attempt to read an invalid index results in a controlled panic (with an explicit error message) rather than undefined behavior. Additionally, the index used in the concurrent thread within execute() has been changed to a valid value (2), ensuring deterministic and safe execution.
