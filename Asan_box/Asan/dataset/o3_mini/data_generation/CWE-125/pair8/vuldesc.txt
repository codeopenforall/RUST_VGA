This code allocates a buffer encapsulated in a struct and provides an accessor that unsafely reads a value using unchecked pointer dereferencing (via get_unchecked). Since no bounds checking is performed in the read_value_public method (and similarly in unsafe_read), providing an index beyond the allocated range (e.g. index 12 in a 10‐element vector) leads to an out-of-bounds read. Such usage of unsafe blocks without proper validation closely mimics real-world vulnerabilities reported in RustSec for CWE-125.
