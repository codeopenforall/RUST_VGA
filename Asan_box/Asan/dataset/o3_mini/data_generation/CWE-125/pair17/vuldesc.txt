In this snippet, the Buffer structure provides a method to compute a sum over a slice of its data. The method uses an unsafe block with get_unchecked to access elements without verifying that the requested index is within bounds. Supplying a range that extends past the end of the vector (e.g. requesting 5 elements from a 4-element vector) triggers an out-of-bounds read, representing CWE-125. Concurrency is demonstrated by performing the calculation on a cloned smart pointer in a separate thread.
