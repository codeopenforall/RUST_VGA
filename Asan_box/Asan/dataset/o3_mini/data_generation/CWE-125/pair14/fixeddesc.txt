This corrected version introduces an explicit bounds check before accessing the buffer. In the operate() method, the index is compared with the buffer length; if it is out-of-bound, the function returns None instead of proceeding with an unsafe memory read. This change ensures that the function does not perform an out-of-bound read, mitigating the vulnerability while preserving the original interface.
