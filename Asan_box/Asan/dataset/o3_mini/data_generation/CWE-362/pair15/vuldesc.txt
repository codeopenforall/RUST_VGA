This version uses an unsafe global raw pointer to share a mutable Counter between threads without any synchronization. In the loop where each thread increments the counter (line 25), the lack of protection against concurrent modifications leads to a race condition (CWE-362). Under heavy concurrency, some increments may be lost, and the final value is unlikely to match the expected total.
