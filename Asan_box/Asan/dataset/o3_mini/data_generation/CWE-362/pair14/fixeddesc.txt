The corrected code eliminates the race condition by replacing the UnsafeCell-based 
access with an AtomicU32. The atomic compare_exchange operation ensures that only one 
thread can successfully change the count from 0 to 1. This guarantees that even if multiple 
threads attempt the operation concurrently, exactly one thread will perform the update, 
ensuring correctness.
