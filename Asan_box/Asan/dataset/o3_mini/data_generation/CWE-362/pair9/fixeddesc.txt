The corrected version fixes the race condition by replacing unsafe unsynchronized access with proper synchronization. By wrapping the shared Worker instance in an Arc and Mutex, only one thread can update the counter and finished flag at a time. This guarantees that when the counter reaches 10, the finished flag is reliably set.
