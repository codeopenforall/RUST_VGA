The code above suffers from a race condition due to unsynchronized access on a shared global mutable pointer (GLOBAL). Multiple threads concurrently access and modify the same Data without any atomic or locking mechanism. The check-then-act sequence in the unsafe block creates a window for TOCTOU issues, leading to unpredictable final state. This mirrors real-world issues where unsafe pointer manipulation and concurrent unsynchronized access cause race conditions.
