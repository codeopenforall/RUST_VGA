The code above suffers from a race condition (CWE-362). It uses an unsafe global pointer (GLOBAL) to share a mutable Data structure among multiple threads without any synchronization. In the critical section (lines where the code reads (*GLOBAL).count and then writes back an incremented value), concurrent threads may interleave their execution. This leads to lost updates and an incorrect final count because the read-modify-write sequence is not atomic.
