In the corrected version the process method properly propagates errors from the unsafe operation. Instead of converting an error into a success value, it uses the try operator (the ? syntax) to return the error immediately if one occurs. This ensures that any failure from the unsafe memory copy is correctly signaled to the caller. The corrected error propagation guarantees that boundary checks are enforced and the vulnerability is mitigated.
