The fixed code now correctly interprets the return value from the unsafe function "obtain". In both the single-threaded and multi-threaded operations, a Some(value) indicates that the unsafe pointer dereference succeeded. The conditional logic has been revised to return success when a valid value is obtained and only return an error if None is encountered.
