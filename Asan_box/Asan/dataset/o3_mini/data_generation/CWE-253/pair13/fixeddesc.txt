In this corrected version the return value from the unsafe copy operation is properly checked. The "run" method now treats a return value of 0 from "simulated_copy" as success and any non-zero value as an error. This proper evaluation of the function's result aligns with the intended contract and prevents the inverted logic that led to the vulnerability in the previous version, while still demonstrating realistic concurrency and unsafe block usage.
