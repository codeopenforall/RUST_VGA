This version contains a vulnerability where the return value from a low-level unsafe operation is misinterpreted. When the operation fails (returns an Err), the code incorrectly treats it as a success by returning true rather than false. This flawed error handling (CWE-253: Incorrect Check of Function Return Value) may lead to unsafe assumptions about successful operations.
