In the fixed version the perform_update method properly distinguishes between valid and invalid inputs: it returns an error for negative values rather than misinterpreting them as a success.
Moreover, the update logic in run_tasks now refrains from modifying the shared state when an error occurs. 
This correction prevents the unintended propagation of invalid data, resolving the misinterpretation issue while still demonstrating realistic use of unsafe blocks, smart pointers, and concurrent thread execution.
