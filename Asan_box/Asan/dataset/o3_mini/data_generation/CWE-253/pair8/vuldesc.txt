The vulnerability arises from an incorrect check of the return value from an unsafe function call.
Specifically, the unsafe_modification function returns 0 to indicate success and a nonzero value to indicate an error.
However, the modify method mistakenly treats any nonzero return (i.e. an error condition)
as success, and only returns an error when the return code is 0.
This misinterpretation can lead to downstream operations believing that an update was performed successfully,
even though in reality the operation failed, especially within concurrent contexts.
