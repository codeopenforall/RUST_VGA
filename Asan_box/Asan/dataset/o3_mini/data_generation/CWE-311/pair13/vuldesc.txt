This code reads a sensitive configuration from disk and transmits it as plaintext over a network connection without any encryption or integrity protection. It also employs an unsafe block to convert a string into a byte slice, bypassing Rust’s safety checks. Such behavior exposes the secret data (e.g., credentials or keys) to interception, directly embodying CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data.
