This code loads a sensitive secret and then uses an unsafe block to extract its raw bytes,
transmitting them directly over an insecure channel (simulated by returning the plaintext).
The unsafe block and direct memory access bypass proper abstraction and encryption,
leaving the secret exposed (CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data).
