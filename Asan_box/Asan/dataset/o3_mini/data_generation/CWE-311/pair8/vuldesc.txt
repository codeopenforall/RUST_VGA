This code demonstrates a security flaw where sensitive configuration data (an API key and a database password) is stored directly on disk in cleartext. An unsafe block is used to access the underlying memory of the API key, mimicking low-level operations often found in real-world applications. The vulnerability falls under CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) because the sensitive information is not encrypted prior to storage, making it susceptible to exposure.
