In this corrected version the API key is no longer transmitted in plaintext. A simple XOR encryption is applied in the transmit() method via the helper function xor_cipher before data is sent. Although XOR is not recommended for cryptographic security in production, this example demonstrates the proper handling by encrypting the sensitive data (thereby mitigating CWE-311) and preserving a realistic concurrency pattern.
