In this corrected version, prior to transmission the secret is processed through a simple XOR encryption function. The output of process_output is no longer the cleartext secret but an obfuscated version of it. This change mitigates the vulnerability of transmitting sensitive data in clear text. The overall structure including concurrency and configuration remains similar to the original design, ensuring minimal disruption to the program logic.
