In this corrected version the design properly enforces authorization before granting access to sensitive data. The run method explicitly checks if the caller has administrative privileges and returns an error ("Unauthorized access") when they do not. By eliminating unsafe pointer misuse and adding the necessary authorization check, the code adheres to CWE-285 and follows secure concurrency best practices.
