In this revision the sensitive accessor method is made safe by removing the unsafe block. More importantly, 
the Service::handle function now strictly checks that the caller’s role is "admin". As a result, any unprivileged 
attempt (e.g. using "user") will be denied access. This corrects the improper authorization flaw (CWE-285) found 
in the earlier version.
