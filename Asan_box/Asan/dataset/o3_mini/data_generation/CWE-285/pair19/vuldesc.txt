This snippet simulates a resource manager that should restrict access to a sensitive resource.
Due to an improper authorization check (the check is missing entirely), any caller regardless of role
can retrieve the secret value. The unsafe block is used to access the resource directly. This mimics
real-world scenarios where neglecting proper access control can lead to unauthorized data disclosure, as seen in CWE-285.
