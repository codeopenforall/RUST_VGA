The corrected code introduces a proper authorization check within the access method. Now, before attempting to retrieve the secure data, the code verifies whether the caller has administrative privileges. If the user is not an administrator, it returns an error, thereby preventing unauthorized access. This change effectively mitigates the CWE-285 vulnerability.
