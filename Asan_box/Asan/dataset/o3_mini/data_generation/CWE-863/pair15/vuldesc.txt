This vulnerable code accepts a numeric parameter from the command line and uses it
to spawn an unbounded number of threads. Each thread allocates a vector with a size
multiplied by a constant and fills it via unsafe pointer operations. There is no check
on the input value, leading to potential resource exhaustion, integer overflows, and
memory allocation issues. This is indicative of CWE-863 (Resource Exhaustion due to
lack of proper authorization checks on resource usage limits).
