This code implements a resource allocation routine that spawns an unbounded number of threads based on user input,
and within each thread executes an unsafe memory operation. No limits or authorization checks are in place,
thus allowing a user to specify an arbitrarily high number of threads, potentially exhausting system resources (CWE-863).
The missing resource caps make it vulnerable to misuse, leading to denial-of-service conditions.
