The fixed version introduces a constant MAX_TASKS that limits the number of threads/tasks that can be created.
Before spawning any threads, the execute function checks if the requested number of tasks exceeds this threshold.
If so, it immediately returns an error instead of proceeding, preventing resource exhaustion.
This enforces proper authorization of resource consumption and mitigates the vulnerability.
