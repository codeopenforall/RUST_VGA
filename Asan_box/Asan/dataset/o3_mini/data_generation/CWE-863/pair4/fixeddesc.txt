In this revision the execute_request function first checks whether the requested number of tasks exceeds a pre-defined safe limit (SAFE_LIMIT). If so, it aborts by returning an error rather than proceeding to spawn threads. Furthermore, the unsafe raw pointer update has been replaced with a thread-safe AtomicUsize counter, eliminating the race condition and preventing unbounded resource allocation.
