In this corrected implementation the code accumulates u32 values into a u64 accumulator, which prevents the overflow that occurred in the original version. Although an unsafe block is still used to preserve legacy pointer-based iteration, each read value is cast to u64. Both the multiplication and addition operations employ checked arithmetic to ensure that any overflow triggers an error rather than silently wrapping around.
