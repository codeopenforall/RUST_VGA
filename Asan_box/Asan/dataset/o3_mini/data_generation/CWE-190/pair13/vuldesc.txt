This code suffers from CWE-190: Integer Overflow. The vulnerability arises in the compute_size() method where multiplication of two u32
values (count and element_size) is performed using wrapping_mul without proper checks. When the mathematical result exceeds u32::MAX,
the computed size wraps around, leading to an allocation that is significantly smaller than intended. This miscalculation can result in 
buffer overruns when the code writes to the allocated memory.
