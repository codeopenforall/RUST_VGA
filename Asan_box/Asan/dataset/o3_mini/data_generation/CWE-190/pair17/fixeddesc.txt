In the corrected implementation the multiplication is performed safely by first promoting the operands to u64,
thus ensuring that the product (which should be 5,000,000,000) can be represented without truncation.
The code uses checked_mul to explicitly verify that no overflow occurs. The unsafe raw pointer manipulation
present in the vulnerable version has been removed, and although concurrency via Arc<Mutex<_>> remains for realism,
all arithmetic is now performed using safe idioms.
