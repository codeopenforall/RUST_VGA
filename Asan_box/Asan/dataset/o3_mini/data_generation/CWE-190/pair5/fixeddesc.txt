The revised code replaces the unsafe unchecked multiplication with Rust’s checked multiplication via the checked_mul method. By doing so, it explicitly detects and reports an overflow scenario by returning an error ("overflow") when the multiplication exceeds u32’s capacity. This approach mitigates the integer wraparound vulnerability, preserving the intended contract and preventing erroneous computations while keeping the realistic usage of concurrency and smart pointers.
