This code simulates concurrent transactions on a shared ledger. Each thread adds a large amount to the balance using an unsafe block that performs unchecked addition. When multiple threads add 300,000,000 repeatedly, the cumulative result should be 3,000,000,000, which exceeds the maximum for a 32-bit integer. However, due to the unchecked arithmetic, the result wraps around, leading to an incorrect balance. This emulates CWE-190 Integer Overflow vulnerabilities found in real-world scenarios.
