The code above exposes a sensitive secret via error messages. During an error condition in process_data, it uses an unsafe block to read the secret from memory and then embeds the raw secret directly into the error message. This leads to inadvertent leakage of confidential information (CWE-200) during logging or panic conditions. The use of concurrency (Arc and Mutex) along with unsafe pointer operations mimics real-world patterns where concurrency bugs and unsafe code interactions can inadvertently leak secrets.
