The code above demonstrates a scenario of CWE-200 where sensitive data (a password) is exposed through logging and error handling. The custom Debug and Display implementations for the Credential and error types print the secret password, risking exposure during error logging, especially when the username is too short. The complexity is increased with the use of unsafe blocks and concurrent threads.
