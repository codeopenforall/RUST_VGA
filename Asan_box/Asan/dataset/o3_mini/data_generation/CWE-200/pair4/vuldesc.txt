This code simulates a system where sensitive configuration data (the secret key) is inadvertently exposed in error and panic messages. The vulnerability occurs when an error is returned from process_request or when a panic is raised in a concurrently spawned thread – both include Debug output of the configuration struct (which contains the secret). Unsafe blocks are used to mimic low-level memory operations, and concurrency is introduced via thread spawning, reflecting realistic patterns seen in some RustSec reports.
