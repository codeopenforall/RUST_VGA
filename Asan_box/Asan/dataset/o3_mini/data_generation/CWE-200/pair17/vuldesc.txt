This version contains an exposure of sensitive information vulnerability (CWE-200). When an invalid input is provided (anything other than "safe"), the program enters an unsafe block to extract the stored secret via raw pointer dereferencing. This secret is then embedded directly in the error message (and subsequent panic), potentially leaking confidential data to logs or crash reports.
