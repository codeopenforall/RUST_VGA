This version of the program uses an unsafe block to bypass some safety checks and then inadvertently leaks a sensitive secret through its error message.
The function process_data extracts the secret from the Holder struct using raw pointer manipulation and includes the secret value directly in the error string,
leading to exposure of sensitive data (CWE-200). The use of concurrency further increases the risk of inadvertent logging in a production scenario.
