The vulnerability involves the exposure of sensitive information (CWE-200) by printing the debug representation of a configuration
structure that contains a secret. In the error-handling branch, the secret is printed inside the panic error message, and the unsafe
block simulates real-world concurrency patterns where raw pointers are used, increasing the risk of such mistakes in complex systems.
