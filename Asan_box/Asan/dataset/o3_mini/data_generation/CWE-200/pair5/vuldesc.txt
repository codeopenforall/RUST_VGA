This code leaks sensitive information (the secret "SuperSecret123") when an invalid input is provided,
by incorporating the secret into the error message returned in the process() method. The unsafe block
and raw pointer dereference emphasize a misuse of low-level operations, leading to CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information).
Concurrent threads further demonstrate a realistic usage scenario.
