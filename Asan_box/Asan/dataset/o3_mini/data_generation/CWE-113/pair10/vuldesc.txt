The above vulnerable code builds an HTTP response by directly embedding untrusted input into header values without sanitizing CR and LF control characters. By using an unsafe block to perform raw pointer operations during string concatenation, the code inadvertently permits CRLF injection, which can lead to HTTP Response Splitting. This is a realistic example mimicking vulnerabilities reported in RustSec related to unsafe systems programming.
