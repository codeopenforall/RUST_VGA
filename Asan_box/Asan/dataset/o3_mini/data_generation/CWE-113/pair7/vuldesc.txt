The code above constructs an HTTP response by appending header lines via an unsafe block that copies a formatted string into a vector without sanitizing the untrusted input. Because the header value is taken directly from the client (or an untrusted source) and inserted into the response header without filtering out CR (carriage return) or LF (line feed) characters, an attacker can inject additional header lines (HTTP Response Splitting). Concurrency and manual memory handling via raw pointers add to the complexity and realism of potential real-world misuse.
