This code constructs an HTTP response header by directly embedding untrusted input without validation. The untrusted input may contain CR (Carriage Return) or LF (Line Feed) characters that allow an attacker to inject additional headers, thus demonstrating HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113). The vulnerability is exacerbated by the use of an unsafe block to recreate a string from raw pointers, mimicking complex unsafe operations found in real-world systems.
