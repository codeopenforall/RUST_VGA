This code accepts untrusted input as the value for an HTTP header without filtering out
carriage return and line feed characters. It uses an unsafe block to convert the raw bytes
of the input to a string slice, bypassing UTF-8 validation on injected CRLF sequences.
An attacker may exploit this behavior to perform HTTP response splitting attacks by injecting
malicious headers.
