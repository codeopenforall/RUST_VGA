This version constructs an HTTP header by embedding untrusted input directly using format! without filtering carriage return (CR) or line feed (LF) characters. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject CRLF sequences (e.g., “\r\nInjected: malicious”), potentially leading to HTTP Response Splitting vulnerabilities. The use of unsafe blocks and concurrent threads mimics real-world unsafe practices where such mistakes might slip through.
