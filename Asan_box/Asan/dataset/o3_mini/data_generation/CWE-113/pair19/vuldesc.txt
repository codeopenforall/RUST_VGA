This version builds an HTTP response by directly incorporating user-supplied input into header fields without any sanitization. In the add_field method, the unsafe block uses from_utf8_unchecked to convert the input bytes into a string without validating or filtering out CR (carriage return) and LF (line feed) characters. Consequently, malicious input containing CRLF sequences can inject extra headers, thereby leading to HTTP Response Splitting (CWE-113). The use of threading simulates a realistic concurrent environment found in production systems.
