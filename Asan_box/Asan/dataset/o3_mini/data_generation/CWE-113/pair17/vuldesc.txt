This code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting (CWE-113). The issue arises because untrusted input is concatenated directly into HTTP headers without any validation or sanitization. An unsafe block is employed to manually manipulate the underlying memory of the header string, bypassing Rust's standard safety guarantees. As a result, an attacker can inject CRLF sequences (e.g. "\r\n") to create additional headers, leading to HTTP response splitting.
