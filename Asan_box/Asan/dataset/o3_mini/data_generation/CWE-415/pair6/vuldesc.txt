The above code demonstrates a double free vulnerability (CWE-415). It allocates memory via Box,
converts it into a raw pointer, and then frees it manually (in manual_drop) without nullifying
the pointer. When the Resource is dropped, its Drop implementation frees the memory again.
A global atomic counter (FREE_COUNT) is used to simulate detection (by panicking on the second free).
This design mimics real-world unsafe manual deallocation errors seen in RustSec reports.
