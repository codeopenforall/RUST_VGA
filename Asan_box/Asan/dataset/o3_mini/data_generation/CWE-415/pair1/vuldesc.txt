This version of the code introduces a double free vulnerability. 
A heap allocation is performed in the constructor and its raw pointer is stored in a struct.
Instead of transferring unique ownership, the raw pointer is duplicated by creating a second instance.
In the Drop implementation, the global atomic flag FREED is used to allow the first drop to free the memory,
but the second drop inadvertently frees the same memory a second time, causing undefined behavior and triggering a panic.
This pattern mirrors real-world unsafe usage reported for similar issues.
