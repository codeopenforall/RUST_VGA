This code suffers from an uncontrolled resource allocation flaw (CWE-770). It accepts a count that determines how many threads to spawn, without any limits. Each thread performs an unsafe memory allocation and deallocation in an unsafe block. When provided with a huge task count, the system may exhaust its resources (threads and memory), leading to a denial-of-service condition or a crash. This reflects the real-world vulnerability as seen in various RustSec reports.
