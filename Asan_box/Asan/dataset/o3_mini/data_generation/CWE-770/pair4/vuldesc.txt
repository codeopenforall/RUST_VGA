This version suffers from CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits.
It accepts an arbitrary number “n” and uses unsafe pointer arithmetic to write to a vector 
that was not pre-allocated. Writing beyond the allocated memory causes undefined behavior 
or memory corruption, particularly when “n” is large, leading to potential denial-of-service 
or compromise of program integrity.
