This code accepts a user-defined allocation size and spawns a thread that allocates a vector with that exact capacity without any bound-checking. It then unsafely sets the length of the vector using set_len, ignoring memory initialization guarantees. Consequently, if a very large allocation size is provided, it can exhaust system memory or lead to undefined behavior. This pattern mimics real-world issues where unbounded resource allocation culminates in denial-of-service vulnerabilities.
