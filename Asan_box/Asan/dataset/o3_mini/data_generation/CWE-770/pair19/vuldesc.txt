This code demonstrates a classic resource exhaustion vulnerability (CWE-770). It spawns a number of threads equal to the user-supplied input without imposing any limit. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the unsafe block that manually manipulates raw pointers in a concurrent setting, mimicking patterns seen in real-world FFI or low-level concurrency libraries. An attacker could trigger failure or denial-of-service by supplying a very high thread count.
