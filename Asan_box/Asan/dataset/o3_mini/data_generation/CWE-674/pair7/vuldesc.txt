This version implements a recursive descent parser that processes nested parentheses. It uses an unsafe block for creating new nodes and performs recursion without any limit. When processing deeply nested inputs, this unbounded recursion may lead to a stack overflow (CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion) which is exploited when attacker-controlled input contains excessive levels of nesting.
