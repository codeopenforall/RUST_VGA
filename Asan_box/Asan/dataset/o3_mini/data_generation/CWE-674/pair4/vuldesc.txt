This version implements a recursive descent parser using unsafe pointer arithmetic and recursive calls without any depth limiting. When provided with a deeply nested input (e.g. many nested parentheses), the uncontrolled recursion will eventually exhaust the stack and result in a stack overflow. The use of unsafe blocks and concurrent thread spawning mimics realistic patterns found in complex systems, making this code vulnerable to CWE-674.
