This vulnerable code fails to properly validate user-controlled input regarding the expected slice length. 
An unchecked conversion is performed via an unsafe block using std::slice::from_raw_parts and std::str::from_utf8_unchecked.
By allowing a user to specify a length greater than the actual size of the underlying buffer, the program may read memory out-of-bounds,
leading to potential security issues, undefined behavior, or information disclosure.
