This vulnerable implementation reads a 4‑byte header from user‐controlled input to determine
the payload length but fails to validate that the provided data actually contains that many bytes.
The unsafe block uses pointer arithmetic along with from_raw_parts to blindly read the payload,
leading to potential out‐of-bound memory access and undefined behavior when the length is manipulated.
This is a realistic example of CWE-020: Improper Input Validation in low-level Rust code.
