This code reads a user-supplied number from the command line and uses it to determine the length of a slice taken from a fixed buffer. The conversion of the raw byte slice into a string is performed within an unsafe block using from_utf8_unchecked without verifying that the user-supplied length is within the bounds of the buffer. This improper input validation may lead to out-of-bounds memory reads and undefined behavior.
