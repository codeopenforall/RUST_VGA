This corrected version introduces explicit input validation prior to performing any unsafe pointer arithmetic. Before dereferencing the pointer, it verifies that the supplied index is less than the length of the data vector. If the check fails, the program panics with an appropriate error message. This change prevents out‑of‑bounds memory access while still employing unsafe code in a controlled manner.
