This implementation unsafely parses HTTP header fields. It uses an unsafe block to perform unchecked UTF-8 conversion and raw pointer arithmetic to locate the "Content-Length:" header. As a result, when multiple Content-Length headers are present (a scenario common in request smuggling attacks), it simply returns the first parsed value without detecting the inconsistency. This is analogous to CWE-444, where inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities.
