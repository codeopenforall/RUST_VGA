This code improperly handles duplicate HTTP "Content-Length" headers by using an unsafe block to sum the first two header values. In real-world HTTP request smuggling scenarios, inconsistent header interpretations between proxy and backend can be exploited. The unsafe pointer arithmetic fails to enforce the proper semantics (i.e. selecting only one authoritative value) and can be manipulated to yield an unintended computed length.
