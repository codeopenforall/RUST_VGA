The corrected version enforces unambiguous HTTP header interpretation. Instead of silently processing ambiguous requests, it explicitly rejects any HTTP request that contains both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a "Content-Length" header. Additionally, it replaces unsafe operations with safe Rust slicing and standard library routines, ensuring robust boundary checks and preventing unsafe memory access.
