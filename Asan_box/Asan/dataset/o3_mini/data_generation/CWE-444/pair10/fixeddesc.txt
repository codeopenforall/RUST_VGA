In the secure implementation, the header parsing is accomplished with safe string search methods eliminating the unsafe pointer arithmetic.
Moreover, the request processing function now actively inspects for the malicious header ("X-Extra: exploit")
and correctly rejects the request if it is present. This explicit check prevents inconsistent interpretation,
thereby mitigating the risk of request smuggling.
