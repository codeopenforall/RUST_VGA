This version features an unsafe header parser that scans for the CRLFCRLF sequence using raw pointer arithmetic.
Due to a misinterpretation, if the HTTP request contains the malicious header "X-Extra: exploit",
the function erroneously accepts the request rather than rejecting it.
This inconsistent interpretation of the HTTP headers can allow a request smuggling attack.
