The above implementation is vulnerable due to inconsistent interpretation of duplicate HTTP headers, specifically "Content-Length". By using an unsafe block and directly converting and slicing byte arrays, the parser overwrites a previously set header value if it appears more than once. In environments where proxies and backends rely on different header interpretations (e.g., the first versus the last occurrence), an attacker can craft a request that triggers a request smuggling vulnerability. This inconsistency (CWE-444) may allow additional requests to be injected or interpreted differently by downstream systems.
