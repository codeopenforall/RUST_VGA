The corrected version eliminates the use-after-free by retaining ownership of the allocated memory. Instead of converting the Box into a raw pointer and prematurely freeing it, the resource now directly owns a Box. The method simply dereferences the Box safely. This fix leverages Rust’s ownership and lifetime system properly and avoids unsafe memory operations, thereby resolving the use-after-free vulnerability.
