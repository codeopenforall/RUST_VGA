This code allocates a boxed structure, immediately converts it into a raw pointer and then drops it—freeing the underlying memory. A secondary thread re-allocates memory at the same location and writes a new value. Later, the code unsafely dereferences the dangling pointer, leading to a use-after-free condition (CWE-416). This scenario mimics real-world issues often seen in unsafe Rust code interacting with manual memory management.
