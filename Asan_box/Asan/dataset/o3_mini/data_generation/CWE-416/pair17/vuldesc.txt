This code exhibits a use‐after‐free vulnerability. A heap‐allocated object is freed via Box::from_raw(),
and then its memory is deliberately overwritten using ptr::write. Subsequent dereference of the raw pointer
accesses memory that has been freed (and tampered with), mimicking real-world unsafe aliasing issues.
Such bugs have been documented (e.g., CWE-416) and can lead to unpredictable behavior.
