In the corrected version, the unsafe block is still present for demonstration purposes, but the flaw is eliminated by removing the unconditional "|| true" clause. The validate() method now performs a strict equality check against the trusted origin ("https://trusted.example.com") and returns false for any other value. This ensures that requests with a malicious "Origin" header are properly rejected, mitigating the trust issues associated with header-based origin validation.
