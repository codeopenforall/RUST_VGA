This vulnerable code simulates an HTTP request processing service that blindly trusts the "Origin" header received from the client. It uses an unsafe block to construct a string prefix ("http") and concatenates the header value without proper validation. This oversight may allow attackers to supply malicious origins, leading to SSRF or CSRF pivot vulnerabilities by tricking the service into interacting with unintended URLs.
