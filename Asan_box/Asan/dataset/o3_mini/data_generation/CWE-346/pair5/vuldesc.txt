This vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to convert a header string from a request into a C-style string (CStr) without verifying that the original Rust String is null-terminated. When a malicious actor injects an internal null byte (for example, "https://trusted.com\0.evil"), the unsafe conversion causes the string to be truncated at the null byte, bypassing the intended origin validation. As a result, an attacker can spoof a trusted origin even though the full header is not legitimate.
