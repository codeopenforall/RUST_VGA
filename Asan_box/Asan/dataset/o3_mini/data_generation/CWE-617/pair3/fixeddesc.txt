The revised code removes the direct assert! and instead introduces a validate() method that returns a Result. The execute() function now propagates errors gracefully without panicking, even when attacker-controlled input is used. As a result, an input equal to or exceeding 100 no longer leads to a reachable assertion failure, effectively mitigating the denial-of-service vulnerability.
