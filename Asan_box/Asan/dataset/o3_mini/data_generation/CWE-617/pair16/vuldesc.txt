This implementation uses an unsafe global pointer for application configuration, which is set
directly based on user input. The absence of input validation before storing the configuration
allows an attacker to supply a value for the threshold that violates an invariant (i.e., it must be
less than 100). This leads to a reachable assertion (assert!()) in the process function. Additionally,
using unsynchronized mutable global state with unsafe blocks further exacerbates the risk of data races.
Such patterns have been observed in real-world vulnerabilities reported in RustSec.
