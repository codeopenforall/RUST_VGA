The vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to write a user-controlled (attacker-influenced) value directly into an internal counter, bypassing proper input validation. Afterwards, it relies on a reachable assertion to ensure the counter remains below a specified limit. If an attacker supplies a value greater than the limit (e.g., 150 when the limit is 100), the assertion is reached and triggers a panic, leading to a denial-of-service. This pattern mirrors real-world issues where unsafe operations combined with delayed validation can result in critical failures.
