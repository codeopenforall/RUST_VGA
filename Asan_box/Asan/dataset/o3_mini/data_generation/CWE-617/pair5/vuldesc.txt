This version defines a shared data structure that holds a vector of ten elements and provides an update function that unsafely writes to memory using raw pointers. The function uses an unsafe block to write a value at an attacker-supplied index and then asserts that the index is within the bounds of the vector. Because the check occurs after the unsafe write and is directly influenced by external input, an attacker may use an out-of-range index (e.g. 15) to trigger the assertion, resulting in a panic and leading to a denial-of-service scenario.
