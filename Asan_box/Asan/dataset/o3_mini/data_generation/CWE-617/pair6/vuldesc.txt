This code unsafely modifies shared state within a concurrent context by bypassing Rust’s safety checks with an unsafe block. The function alter() directly writes an attacker-controlled value (999) into shared memory without validation, violating the invariant that the state must remain below 100. Such an attacker-influenced reachable assertion triggers a denial-of-service scenario, aligning with CWE-617.
