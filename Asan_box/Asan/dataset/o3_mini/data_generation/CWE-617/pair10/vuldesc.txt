The application unsafely updates a global mutable variable (SHARED) across multiple threads without proper synchronization. 
The unsynchronized unsafe block (lines 15–18) may lead to a data race and unpredictable state, allowing an attacker 
to supply a high increment value to drive the global state beyond a safe THRESHOLD, which in turn triggers a reachable assertion (line 27) causing a denial-of-service.
