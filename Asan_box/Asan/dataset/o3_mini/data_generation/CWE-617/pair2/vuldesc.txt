The vulnerability stems from the unchecked use of an attacker–controlled index in an unsafe block.
Specifically, the method "process" in the trait implementation dereferences a raw pointer without validating that the index
yields an element meeting the invariant (value greater than 100). An attacker can supply an index (for example, 0)
so that the element (50) causes the reachable assertion to fail. This leads to a panic and potential denial-of-service.
