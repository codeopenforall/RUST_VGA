In the corrected code the vulnerability is mitigated by adding proper input validation and boundary checks.
Before performing any unsafe operations, the code verifies that the provided index is within the vector's range
and that the selected element meets the invariant (being greater than 100). This change prevents attacker–controlled
inputs from triggering a reachable assertion, thereby preventing a denial-of-service condition. The unsafe block has been
eliminated in favor of safe, idiomatic Rust.
