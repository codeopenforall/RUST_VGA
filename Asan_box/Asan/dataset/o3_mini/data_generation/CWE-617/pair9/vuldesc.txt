This code is vulnerable to a reachable assertion (CWE-617). The external threshold provided by an attacker is used directly in an assert! that validates the data fetched via an unsafe pointer access. If an attacker supplies a threshold lower than the actual fetched value (for example, an index yielding a value equal to the threshold), the assertion fails, triggering a panic and causing a potential denial-of-service in concurrent environments.
