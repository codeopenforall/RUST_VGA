The corrected code eliminates the reachable assertion vulnerability by removing the unsafe pointer arithmetic and the assert!() that directly depended on attacker input. It instead performs safe bounds checking and validates the value using conventional control flow. If an invalid index is provided or if the value is below the defined threshold, the function returns an error, thereby preventing unexpected panics and mitigating the denial-of-service risk seen in the vulnerable version.
