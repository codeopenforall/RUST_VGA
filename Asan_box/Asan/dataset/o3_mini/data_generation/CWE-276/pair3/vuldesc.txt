This code spawns multiple threads that concurrently open and write to a log file. The file is created
with overly permissive permissions (mode 0o777) using OpenOptionsExt. Such permissions allow any user on
the system to read or modify the file, thus exposing it to unauthorized access and manipulation. An
unsafe block is used in a trivial pointer manipulation, mimicking potential real-world unsafe practices.
