The code above creates a configuration file "test_config.cfg" using an insecure default mode (0o777). This overly permissive permission setting (world-readable, writable, and executable) can allow unauthorized users to alter the file. Additionally, the use of an unsafe block and concurrent access via threads emulates real-world patterns where such oversights may lead to potential exploitation.
