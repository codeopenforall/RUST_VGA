This version employs an unsafe block to simulate low-level pointer manipulations and concurrently creates a file with overly permissive permissions (0o777). The insecure file mode can allow unintended access to the created file, representing CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions). The use of concurrency further mimics real-world implementations where such mistakes might be overlooked.
