This version demonstrates a security flaw where a file is created with overly permissive permissions (mode 0o777). The code spawns multiple threads that concurrently open and write to a file inside an unsafe block, which bypasses some of Rust’s inherent safety guarantees. As a result, the file becomes accessible to all users, violating the principle of least privilege (CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions).
