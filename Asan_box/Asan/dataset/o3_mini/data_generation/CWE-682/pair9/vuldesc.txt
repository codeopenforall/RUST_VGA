This code snippet contains an arithmetic vulnerability where the scaled average is computed with incorrect operator precedence. The calculation (sum / count) * scale mistakenly performs integer division before multiplication, leading to truncation errors when the average is fractional. Additionally, an unnecessary unsafe block is employed to dereference a pointer to the sum, mimicking real-world unsafe usage patterns. In our test case with data [1, 2] and scale factor 100, the intended correct result should be 150, yet the vulnerable code yields 100.
