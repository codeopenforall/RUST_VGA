The corrected version resolves the arithmetic error by using proper parentheses to calculate the discount.
The fixed logic computes the total price as (price * (100 - discount)) / 100, ensuring that the discount 
is correctly applied. The unsafe block remains to simulate realistic usage of raw pointer dereferencing,
but it is no longer the source of the logic error.
