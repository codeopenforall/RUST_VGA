This code contains an arithmetic vulnerability under CWE-682. The computation is intended to derive (a * b) / c; however, due to incorrect operator grouping, it ends up calculating a * (b / c). In cases where b is less than c, the integer division b/c truncates to 0, causing an incorrect result (e.g., 100 * (3 / 10) evaluates to 0 rather than the expected 30). Unsafe blocks further simulate real-world unsafe pointer manipulations.
