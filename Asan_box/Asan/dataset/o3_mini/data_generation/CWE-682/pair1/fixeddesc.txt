The fixed code resolves the vulnerability by explicitly grouping addition using parentheses.
This ensures that the sum of 'value' and 'factor' is computed before the division, yielding the correct result.
The concurrency and unsafe usage patterns remain unchanged to reflect realistic design choices, 
but the arithmetic logic flaw is properly addressed.
