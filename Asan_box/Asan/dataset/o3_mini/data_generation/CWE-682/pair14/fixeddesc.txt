In this corrected version, the arithmetic is fixed by adding parentheses to explicitly group the subtraction before the multiplication and division. This change ensures that the intended formula ((current - base) * 100) / base is computed, yielding the correct result of 25% for the sample input. The use of unsafe code and threading remains unchanged, preserving the complex structure of the original implementation.
