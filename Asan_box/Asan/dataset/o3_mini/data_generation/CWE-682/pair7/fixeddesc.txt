In this corrected version, the arithmetic expression has been rearranged so that multiplication
and division occur first, yielding the correct interest amount before being added to the base balance.
The unsafe block remains to simulate scenarios involving low-level memory operations, and threading
with Arc ensures realistic concurrency practice. Consequently, with a balance of 100 and an interest
rate of 10, the computation now properly yields 110.
