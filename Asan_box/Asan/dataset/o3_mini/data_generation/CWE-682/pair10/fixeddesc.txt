The fixed version corrects the calculation error by adjusting the grouping of operands. Instead of performing 
(*ptr_base) * (*ptr_multiplier) + addition, it now correctly computes (*ptr_base) * ((*ptr_multiplier) + addition). 
This change resolves the incorrect arithmetic evaluation while keeping the unsafe blocks, concurrency, and smart 
pointer usage intact to reflect realistic Rust programming patterns seen in security advisories.
