This code is intended to compute an error percentage from two values, where the first element represents the total and the second represents a measured amount. The intended calculation is ((total - measured) * 100) / total. However, due to incorrect operator precedence, the code evaluates measured / total * 100 first and then subtracts that result from total, leading to an incorrect outcome. The code also makes use of unsafe pointer arithmetic and spawns a thread to mimic concurrent processing, following patterns seen in real-world RustSec vulnerabilities.
