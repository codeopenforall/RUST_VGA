The above code mimics a real-world vulnerability where an arithmetic calculation is performed incorrectly due to misplaced operator precedence. In the concurrent processing of sensor readings, the intended operation was to multiply each reading by a conversion factor (obtained unsafely) and then divide by a unit divisor. However, the calculation “reading * (unsafe_factor / divisor)” performs the division first (3/2 results in 1 due to integer division), causing each reading to be scaled improperly. This erroneous ordering can lead to significant miscalculations in environments relying on precise arithmetic, as seen in past CWE-682 cases.
