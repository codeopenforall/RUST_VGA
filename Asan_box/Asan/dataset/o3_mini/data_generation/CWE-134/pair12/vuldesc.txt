This code receives a format string from an external source (command-line argument) and passes it directly to the C library function printf via an unsafe block.
By not controlling or sanitizing the format string, an attacker may supply format specifiers (e.g. "%s", "%x", or "%p") to manipulate the output and potentially read or write arbitrary memory.
The usage of concurrency and unsafe FFI makes this a realistic example mimicking reported issues in real-world Rust applications.
