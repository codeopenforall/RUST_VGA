The corrected code resolves the externally-controlled format string vulnerability by employing a fixed format ("%s")
in the sprintf call. Instead of passing the user-supplied payload as the format specifier, the payload is provided
as a separate argument. This prevents any embedded format specifiers in the payload from being interpreted,
thereby mitigating the risk associated with CWE-134.
