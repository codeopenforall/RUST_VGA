This code demonstrates a format string vulnerability (CWE-134) by directly using external input as the format string in a call to libc::snprintf within an unsafe block. The user-controlled string is converted into a C string and passed as the format specifier without argument validation or sanitization. If malicious format specifiers are provided (for example, “%s”, “%x”), it may lead to memory disclosure or other undefined behavior.
