This code demonstrates a format string vulnerability (CWE-134) by using an externally provided
string as the format specifier in a call to the unsafe C function sprintf. The user input is taken 
directly, converted to a C string, and passed as the format without any validation, which can lead 
to unexpected behavior (or worse, memory corruption) if the input contains malicious formatting 
directives. Concurrency is added via threads to mimic real-world usage where shared data might be 
processed concurrently.
