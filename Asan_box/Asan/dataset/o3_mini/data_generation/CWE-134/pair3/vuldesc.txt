This code demonstrates a vulnerability corresponding to CWE-134 (Externally-Controlled Format String). The logger module accepts user input and stores it in a shared resource accessed concurrently. It then unsafely converts the user-supplied string into a C-style string and passes it directly to an external C function (printf) as the formatting string. If the user input contains malicious format specifiers (e.g. "%n"), it can trigger undefined behavior or a security breach.
