The above code demonstrates an externally-controlled format string vulnerability (CWE-134). 
It accepts a user-provided string (for example, via a command-line argument) and passes it directly 
as the format string to an unsafe FFI call to libc's sprintf. If an attacker supplies a malicious 
format (e.g., including extra specifiers like “%x” or “%s”), it can lead to unintended behavior such as 
memory disclosure or crashes. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the unsafe block and concurrent 
execution.
