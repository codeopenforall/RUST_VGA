In this fixed version the vulnerability is mitigated by eliminating the use of the user-supplied string as the format
specifier. Instead, the code uses a fixed formatting pattern via Rust’s safe formatting API (format!). The user input
is interpolated as plain data and not interpreted as formatting instructions, thereby preventing any uncontrolled format
string exploitation.
