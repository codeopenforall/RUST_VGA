In this corrected version, the environment variable "MALICIOUS_PATH" is sanitized to ensure it only contains safe characters before it is used as the PATH value. If the input fails validation or is missing, the code falls back to a trusted default ("/usr/bin"). The unsafe block responsible for C-style string conversion is removed, and the process execution is performed using safe Rust APIs. These changes effectively mitigate the uncontrolled search path vulnerability.
