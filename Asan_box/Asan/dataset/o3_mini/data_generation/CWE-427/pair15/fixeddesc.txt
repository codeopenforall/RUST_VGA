The corrected code completely ignores any attacker-controlled environment input by no longer using unsafe library calls to read the external "MALICIOUS_PATH" variable. Instead, it explicitly uses a trusted, hard-coded PATH value ("/usr/bin") when spawning external processes. This ensures that the search path for executables remains secure and not vulnerable to manipulation, thereby mitigating CWE-427.
