This code unsafely uses an unvalidated library path value, taken from an environment variable, and appends it directly to the system PATH. Additionally, it employs unsafe operations (raw pointer dereferencing without validation) that can lead to an uncontrolled search path element vulnerability (CWE-427). An attacker controlling the CUSTOM_PATH environment variable may influence which binaries get executed.
