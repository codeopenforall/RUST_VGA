This code demonstrates an unsafe memory copy operation that fails to verify that the destination buffer has enough capacity,
thereby allowing an out‐of‐bounds write (CWE-119). The update method unsafely copies len elements starting at a given index,
which, if the sum exceeds the vector’s length, results in memory corruption.
