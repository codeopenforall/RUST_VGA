The vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to write to a raw pointer without any bounds checking. In the function process_operation, write_unchecked is called with an index that can exceed the allocated buffer’s capacity (e.g. index 10 in a capacity-10 buffer, valid indices 0-9). This improper memory access can lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption, matching the patterns of improper restriction of operations within memory bounds (CWE-119). Additionally, the use of threads simulates a real-world concurrent context.
