This code demonstrates an improper memory operation vulnerability (CWE-119) where unsafe pointer arithmetic is used 
to write and read from a buffer without proper bounds checking. When a boundary value (input equal to the size of the buffer) 
is used, the code writes outside the allocated memory. Concurrent access via threads further complicates the issue, 
potentially leading to memory corruption.
