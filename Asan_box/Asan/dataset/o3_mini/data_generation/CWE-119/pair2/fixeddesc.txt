In this corrected version the off‐by‐one error is fixed by changing the loop boundary in the unsafe fill method.
The for‑loop now iterates from 0 up to, but not including, self.size, ensuring that only the intended portion
of memory is written, thus preventing any inadvertent corruption of the extra (sentinel) memory slot.
