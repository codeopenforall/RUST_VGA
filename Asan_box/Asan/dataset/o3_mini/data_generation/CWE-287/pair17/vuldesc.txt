This code suffers from an improper authentication vulnerability where the authentication function
"verify" erroneously compares only the first three characters of the provided token against the expected
credential "secret". An attacker can bypass proper authentication by supplying any token that starts with
"sec", for example "secXXX", which will incorrectly authenticate. The use of unsafe pointer arithmetic
exacerbates the issue by reducing the check to a minimal subset of the token's bytes.
