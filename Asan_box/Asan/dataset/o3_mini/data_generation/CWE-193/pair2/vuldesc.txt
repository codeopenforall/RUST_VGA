This code demonstrates an off-by-one error under the CWE-193 category. The issue arises in the process method where an unsafe index is used to access an element at an index equal to the vector’s length. Since Rust vectors use zero-based indexing, the last valid index is len()-1. Reading at self.data.len() induces undefined behavior by accessing memory beyond the allocated slice.
