This snippet demonstrates a classic fencepost error where the vector’s length is erroneously set to n+1 instead of n,
resulting in one extra uninitialized element. The code uses unsafe blocks and concurrent thread spawning to emulate real-world 
scenarios in systems programming. Such an off-by-one error (CWE-193) may lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption,
or potential security vulnerabilities when the uninitialized element is later accessed.
