The vulnerable version erroneously adjusts the length of the vector by adding 1 without initializing the extra element. In the unsafe block, after copying the input bytes to the vector’s uninitialized memory, the code calls set_len(len + 1) instead of properly allocating extra capacity and initializing the trailing element. This off-by-one/fencepost error may lead to undefined behavior if the uninitialized element is later read or processed, a pattern similar to those reported in CWE-193.
