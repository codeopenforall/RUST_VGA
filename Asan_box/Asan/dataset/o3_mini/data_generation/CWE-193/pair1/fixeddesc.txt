The corrected version fixes the off‐by‐one error by:
1. Safely initializing the vector using “resize” to ensure all elements are properly set.
2. Iterating from 0 up to (but not including) the vector’s length in the “process” method.
3. Using safe indexing (or safe pointer arithmetic bounded by the vector’s length)
to avoid out-of-bound writes.
These changes eliminate the fencepost vulnerability while preserving the intended functionality.
