The fixed version corrects the off-by-one mistake by setting the vector's length to exactly n, 
ensuring that all bytes within the vector have been properly allocated before they are written. 
Additionally, the fill method now iterates over the entire range of indices. This removes the risk 
of accessing uninitialized memory.
