In the corrected version, proper cryptographic verification is implemented. The function now checks that:
1. The signature has exactly 64 bytes.
2. The message context is exactly the trusted value ("trusted_context").
3. The signature is computed deterministically via a simulated signing function (compute_signature) and compared using a constant-time equality check. This ensures that tampered or invalid messages are correctly rejected.
