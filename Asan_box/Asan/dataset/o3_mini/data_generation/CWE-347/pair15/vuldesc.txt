The code improperly verifies the cryptographic signature by using an unsafe pointer equality check on the algorithm string instead of comparing its content. When an algorithm different from the expected "ed25519" is provided, the pointer comparison almost always fails, leading the routine to bypass proper verification and erroneously return true. This flaw can be exploited to accept signatures with an incorrect or malicious algorithm, compromising the intended security.
