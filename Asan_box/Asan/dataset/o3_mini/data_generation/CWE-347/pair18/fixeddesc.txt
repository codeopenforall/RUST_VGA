The corrected code eliminates the vulnerability by strictly enforcing the use of the approved algorithm (value 0) for cryptographic verification. Rather than bypassing validation via an unsafe block, the secure verification function checks that the signature is exactly 64 bytes long, the message content is non-empty, and that the signature has a specific expected value (simulated here by checking that its first byte is 1). This prevents attackers from exploiting the flaw by submitting messages with unapproved algorithms.
