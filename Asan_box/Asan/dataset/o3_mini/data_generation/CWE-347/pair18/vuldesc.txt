The vulnerability arises from the insecure signature verification function. Instead of performing a complete cryptographic check regardless of the algorithm field, the unsafe block bypasses verification when the algorithm field does not equal 0. This flaw permits an attacker to supply messages with a non-approved algorithm identifier and malformed signatures that are erroneously accepted.
