This vulnerable implementation intends to perform cryptographic signature verification, but instead it exploits an unsafe block that reads from a constant pointer and always returns true. As a result, any input – even an obviously invalid signature – will be accepted. This simulates the CWE-347 scenario of "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature", where critical checks are bypassed, exposing the system to impersonation and message tampering attacks.
