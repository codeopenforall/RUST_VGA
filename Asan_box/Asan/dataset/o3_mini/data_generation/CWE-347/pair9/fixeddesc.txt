In this corrected implementation the verification process computes an expected signature by processing both the message and the public key through a deterministic (although simplified) algorithm. The check method then compares the provided signature with the computed one, ensuring that only data with a valid signature is accepted. This fixes the vulnerability by removing the unsafe bypass and reinstating proper signature validation in a concurrent environment.
