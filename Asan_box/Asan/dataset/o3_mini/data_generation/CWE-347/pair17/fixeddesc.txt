The corrected code eliminates the unsafe pointer manipulation and implements a proper verification routine. It computes a secure hash (for illustration, using a simple deterministic algorithm) over the message and compares that with the signature provided. This ensures that only data with a correctly computed signature is accepted, thereby resolving the improper verification vulnerability. Safe Rust constructs and proper error handling replace the unsafe operations.
