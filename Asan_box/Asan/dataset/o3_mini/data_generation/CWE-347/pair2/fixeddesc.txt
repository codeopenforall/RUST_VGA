This corrected code implements proper signature verification by computing an expected signature from the message and public key using a deterministic routine (simulating a cryptographic verification). The unsafe code that bypassed the integrity check has been removed. Only when the provided signature exactly matches the expected signature will the packet be accepted, preventing the signature bypass vulnerability. Concurrency is maintained via Arc and Mutex without compromising safety.
