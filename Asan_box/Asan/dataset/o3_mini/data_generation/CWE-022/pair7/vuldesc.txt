This code accepts a file path as user input and directly joins it with a base directory without any canonicalization or prefix verification. An attacker may supply input such as "../secret.txt" to traverse outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is compounded by the use of unsafe memory operations within concurrent threads, which mirrors real-world issues found in RustSec reports.
