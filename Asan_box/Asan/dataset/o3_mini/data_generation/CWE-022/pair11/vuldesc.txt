This vulnerable code demonstrates a path traversal weakness (CWE-022) where the user input is naively appended to a designated safe directory without any canonicalization or validation. By providing a path like "../secret.txt", an attacker can traverse outside the intended directory. The use of an unsafe block for low-level byte manipulation further mimics real-world unsafe code patterns.
