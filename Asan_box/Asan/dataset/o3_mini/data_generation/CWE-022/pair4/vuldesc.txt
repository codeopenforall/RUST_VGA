This vulnerable implementation accepts a user-supplied file path and naively concatenates it with a base directory using PathBuf::join without performing canonicalization or prefix checks. Attackers can supply malicious input (e.g. "../secret.txt") to traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory. Unsafe usage is demonstrated via an unsafe block that wraps the file opening.
