This code demonstrates a path traversal vulnerability. The program constructs a target file path by naively joining a base directory with a user-supplied relative path. Because no canonicalization or prefix checking is performed, an attacker may supply inputs such as "../outside.txt" to escape the intended directory. The code also includes an unsafe block simulating low-level operations, which is common in real-world legacy or performance-critical sections. Concurrent access is emulated using Arc and Mutex.
