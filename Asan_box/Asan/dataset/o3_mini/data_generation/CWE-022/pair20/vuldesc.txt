This code is vulnerable to CWE-022 (Path Traversal). The function that loads file content naively joins the base directory with the user-supplied relative path without canonicalization. This oversight permits an attacker to use sequences like "../" to traverse directories and access files outside the intended safe directory. Additionally, an unsafe block is used to convert file bytes to a String without proper validation, further exacerbating potential issues.
