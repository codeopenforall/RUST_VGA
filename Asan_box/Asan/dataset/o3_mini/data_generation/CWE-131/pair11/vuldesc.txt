The above code is vulnerable due to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size. Instead of using input.len() to obtain
the actual number of bytes in the string, it mistakenly uses mem::size_of_val(&input), which returns the size of the
reference to the string (typically 16 bytes on 64-bit systems). This results in only a portion of the intended data
being copied to the allocated buffer. In concurrent contexts, this can lead to truncated data, unexpected behavior, or
security issues when the incomplete data is used.
