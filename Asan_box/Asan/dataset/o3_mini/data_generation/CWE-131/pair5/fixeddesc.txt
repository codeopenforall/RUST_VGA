In the fixed code the allocation has been corrected to include an additional byte for the termination character. The duplicate method now uses Layout::from_size_align(len + 1, 1) to correctly compute the buffer size, and the deallocation call uses the same layout. Additionally, the worker’s execute method always returns success, reflecting the intended correct behavior. This realistic fix prevents out-of-bound writes that could corrupt adjacent memory.
