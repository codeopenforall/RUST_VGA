This code reflects untrusted input directly into an HTML template without any escaping or sanitization. The unsafe block is used to simulate low-level memory operations, and the placeholder in the template is replaced with data provided by an external source. As a result, a malicious string containing script tags is directly injected into the HTML output, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (CWE-079).
