This code uses an unsafe block and raw pointer copying to build an HTML response. The untrusted user input is directly
embedded into the HTML without any sanitization or escaping, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-079).
Any attacker-controlled input containing HTML or JavaScript (e.g., a <script> tag) would be rendered as-is.
