The corrected code eliminates the unsafe pointer operations by removing manual memory writes and instead uses standard string manipulation along with HTML escaping. A dedicated helper function escapes special characters such as '<', '>', '&', and quotes before incorporating user input into the template. This prevents the injection of malicious scripts, effectively mitigating the XSS vulnerability (CWE-079).
