This vulnerable code exposes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw (CWE-079) by reflecting user-supplied input directly into an HTML template without proper escaping. An unsafe block is used to convert the raw bytes of the input to a string, bypassing UTF-8 checks and sanitization. In concurrent settings, this pattern can lead to injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript when the rendered result is inserted into a web page.
