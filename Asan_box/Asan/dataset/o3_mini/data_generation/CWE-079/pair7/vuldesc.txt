This code reflects user-supplied input directly into an HTML template without sanitization or escaping. The use of an unsafe block with std::str::from_utf8_unchecked bypasses safety checks, and the direct replacement of placeholders with untrusted data can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-079) attacks when dangerous payloads are provided. The use of Arc, Mutex, and threading mimics patterns seen in real-world applications, adding concurrency that does not mitigate the XSS risk.
