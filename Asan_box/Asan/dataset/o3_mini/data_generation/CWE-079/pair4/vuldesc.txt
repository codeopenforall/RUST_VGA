This code simulates a real-world scenario where untrusted input is directly embedded into an HTML template without proper escaping. The function that appends user data uses an unsafe block to mimic low-level operations seen in complex systems. The vulnerability (CWE-079) arises from directly incorporating user-supplied content (which might contain malicious scripts) into the output, leaving the system open to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
