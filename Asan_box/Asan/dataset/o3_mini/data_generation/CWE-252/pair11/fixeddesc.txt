In this corrected version, all I/O operations have been rigorously checked: file open and write errors are propagated using the '?' operator. The unsafe pointer maneuvers and locks now properly handle potential errors (including a check for mutex poisoning), ensuring that any failure is reported. As a result, the system does not silently ignore critical error conditions.
