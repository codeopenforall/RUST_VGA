The corrected version properly checks the Result returned by the critical function using the '?' operator inside an unsafe block. This ensures that if the input fails the critical check (for example, when input ≥ 100), the error is propagated immediately and further processing is halted. Consequently, the program will output a failure message rather than erroneously continuing.
