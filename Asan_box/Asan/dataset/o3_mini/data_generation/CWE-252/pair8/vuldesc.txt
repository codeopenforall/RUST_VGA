This vulnerable code processes input data by unsafely copying it into a buffer and then concurrently updates a log file across threads.
An unsafe function writes the log message to disk and may return an error (for instance, if the message contains "fail"). However, the error result is immediately discarded (using let _ = ...), resulting in an unchecked return value (CWE-252).
This practice can allow silent failure of critical operations, leading to inconsistent state or loss of important data.
