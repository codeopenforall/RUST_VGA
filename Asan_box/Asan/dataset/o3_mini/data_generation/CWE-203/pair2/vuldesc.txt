This vulnerable implementation of an authentication component enables a timing and error message discrepancy vulnerability (CWE-203). Depending on whether an account exists or if the password is simply incorrect, the function returns distinct error strings ("User not found" vs "Incorrect password for existing user"). Such a pattern can be exploited by an attacker to enumerate valid accounts. Additionally, the use of an unsafe byte‐by‐byte password comparison does not mitigate timing attacks.
