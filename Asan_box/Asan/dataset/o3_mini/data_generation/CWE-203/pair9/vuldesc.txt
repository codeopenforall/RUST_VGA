This code implements an authentication system that utilizes unsafe blocks and concurrent threads to simulate real-world usage. The vulnerability arises because the error messages differ when a non-existent username is supplied versus when a wrong password is provided. Such discrepancies can allow an attacker to infer the existence of specific users (CWE-203). Unsafe pointer arithmetic is employed to mimic lower-level memory operations, further complicating the security posture.
