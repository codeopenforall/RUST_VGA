In the revised implementation the error messages are homogenized. Regardless of whether a username is missing or the password is
incorrect, the method returns "Authentication failed". This removes the observable discrepancy that could be exploited to
determine the existence of a user account, thereby mitigating the CWE-203 vulnerability.
