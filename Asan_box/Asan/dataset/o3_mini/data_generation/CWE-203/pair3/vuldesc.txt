The vulnerable implementation differentiates error messages: it returns "Invalid password" when the password is wrong
and "User does not exist" when the username is missing. This discrepancy can enable an attacker to deduce whether a given
username is registered in the system, thus exposing sensitive state information per CWE-203.
