This vulnerable implementation of the authentication service uses an unsafe block to simulate low-level memory access and concurrent operations using threads and Arc<Mutex<>>.
It exhibits CWE-203 by returning distinct error messages ("User not found" when the user does not exist, and "Invalid password" when the user exists but the password is incorrect). 
These observable discrepancies may allow an attacker to determine valid usernames on the system.
