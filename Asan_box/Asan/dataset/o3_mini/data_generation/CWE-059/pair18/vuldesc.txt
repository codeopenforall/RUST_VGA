This vulnerable code implements a file loader that constructs a full file path by simply concatenating a base directory with user-supplied input. The lack of proper validation (e.g. canonical path resolution) allows attackers to use path traversal sequences such as "../" or manipulate symbolic links to access files outside the intended directory. The unsafe block used to convert the file content into a string further compounds the risk by bypassing safe Rust string handling.
