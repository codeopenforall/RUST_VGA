This code accepts a file path as input and unsafely processes the corresponding file. It converts the input string into a C-style string and then into a vector of bytes using an unsafe block, and it fetches the file metadata without canonicalizing the path. If a symbolic link is detected, it follows the link to open and read the target file without verifying that the resolved path is within an allowed directory. This lack of proper symbolic link resolution and validation can allow an attacker to supply a symlink to an unintended sensitive file, thus leading to CWE-059.
