This version contains a flaw associated with CWE-059: Link Following. The configuration file is loaded without checking whether the provided file path is a symbolic link, allowing an attacker to redirect the path to an unexpected file. Additionally, an unsafe block converts a Rust string into a C-style string without ensuring null-termination, further mimicking real-world unsafe coding practices.
