This code accepts a file path via command-line argument and uses an unsafe block to reconstruct the path from its underlying OS string bytes. If the file is detected as a symbolic link, it is immediately resolved without checking whether the resulting file lies within the pre-approved directory. Consequently, an attacker may craft a symbolic link that points outside the safe directory, leading to CWE-059: the improper restriction of symbolic link resolution.
