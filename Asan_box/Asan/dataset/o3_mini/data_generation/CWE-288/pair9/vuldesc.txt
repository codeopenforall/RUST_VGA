This code implements a request processing system that improperly allows unauthenticated access on a special endpoint. An unsafe global flag “DEBUG_FLAG” is read inside an unsafe block to decide if requests to the “/debug” endpoint should bypass normal token verification. By enabling the debug flag (which has been left true in production code), an attacker or misconfigured system could gain unauthorized access.
