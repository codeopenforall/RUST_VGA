The vulnerability arises from an alternate authentication path that bypasses proper checking when a debug flag is enabled. In this implementation, if the debug configuration is active (even if inadvertently left enabled in production), the code unconditionally returns success, thereby allowing an attacker to bypass authentication. Additionally, the unsafe use of unchecked header conversion intensifies the risk.
