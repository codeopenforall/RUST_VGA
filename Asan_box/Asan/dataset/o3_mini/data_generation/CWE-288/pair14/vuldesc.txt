This version implements an authentication mechanism where the function
"validate" checks a token string against a secret. However, it contains an alternate
authentication path: if the token equals "debug" and a global debug flag remains enabled,
the unsafe block bypasses proper authentication. This vulnerability might be exploited
if debug endpoints or flows are inadvertently left enabled in production, allowing an attacker
to supply the "debug" token and gain unauthorized access (CWE-288).
