The vulnerable code simulates a server authentication service where, if the debug flag is enabled,
an unsafe function called via an unsafe block bypasses the actual secret validation logic. In this
alternate (debug) path (lines 15-16), the unsafe function unconditionally returns true, leading
to an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-288). This error mimics real-world issues where
debug endpoints or alternate flows inadvertently disable proper authentication.
