This snippet exposes a diagnostic endpoint that bypasses authentication. The unsafe block is used to directly access the configuration, and when the debug flag is true the code returns success without verifying the provided credentials. This creates an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-288), as an attacker can exploit the alternate debug flow to gain unauthorized access.
