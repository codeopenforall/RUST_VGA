In this code, the function allocates a vector with a capacity of the input length minus one. It then unsafely sets the vector’s length to this reduced capacity and iterates over the entire input slice, writing each element into the allocated buffer. When the element count exceeds the allocated capacity, an out-of-bounds write occurs, leading to undefined behavior and potential memory corruption.
