This code allocates a vector with a specified capacity and sets its length unsafely,
leaving the memory uninitialized. The update method uses raw pointer arithmetic in an
unsafe block to write to the buffer without bounds checking. When update is called
with an index equal to the vector's length (or beyond), it writes into memory that is
not part of the allocated vector, leading to an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This may
cause memory corruption and undefined behavior.
