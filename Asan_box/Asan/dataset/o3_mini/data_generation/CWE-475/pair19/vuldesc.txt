This implementation uses unsafe pointer arithmetic to copy data from a slice. The unsafe routine computes an offset pointer by adding 1 to the base pointer and then invokes ptr::copy_nonoverlapping with a length equal to the entire buffer size. For an input slice of length N, it attempts to copy N bytes starting at index 1, which overruns the valid memory (which only contains N-1 bytes). This results in undefined behavior as it violates the API preconditions.
