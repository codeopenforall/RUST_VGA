The vulnerability exists in the compute_sum function where an unsafe block is used to sum elements
by directly dereferencing raw pointers. No check is performed to ensure that the provided count
does not exceed the length of the underlying vector. Passing a count larger than buf.len() results in reading
uninitialized or unrelated memory, leading to undefined behavior corresponding to CWE-475.
