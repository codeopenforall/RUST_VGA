This revised version fixes the division by zero vulnerability by explicitly checking the denominator before performing the division. If the denominator is zero, the operation method returns a controlled error ("Division by zero error") rather than triggering an unsafe division. Concurrency and unsafe constructs are maintained solely to mimic real-world patterns while ensuring correct error handling.
