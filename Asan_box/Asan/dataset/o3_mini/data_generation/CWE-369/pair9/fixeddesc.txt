In this corrected version the function first checks whether the divisor is zero before performing the division. If a zero divisor is detected, the function returns an Err with an appropriate error message instead of proceeding with an unsafe division. This ensures safe operation even in concurrent contexts, effectively eliminating the CWE-369 vulnerability.
