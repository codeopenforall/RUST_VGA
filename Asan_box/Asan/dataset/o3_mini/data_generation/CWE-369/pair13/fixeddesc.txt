In this updated version, the code now checks that the divisor is not zero before attempting the division. This is accomplished by modifying the trait method to return a Result and immediately returning an error if the divisor is zero. The unsafe block is still used to reflect the real-world usage pattern; however, the additional check ensures that the division-by-zero scenario is intercepted and handled gracefully. This prevents the panic observed in the previous code and stops potential undefined behavior.
