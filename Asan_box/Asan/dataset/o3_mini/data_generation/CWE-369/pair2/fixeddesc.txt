This corrected version resolves the vulnerability by introducing an explicit check for a zero denominator before performing the division. In the compute method, if the denominator is zero, the function returns an error instead of attempting the unsafe division. This approach prevents runtime panics associated with division by zero while maintaining the use of concurrency and unsafe constructs to reflect realistic system coding patterns.
