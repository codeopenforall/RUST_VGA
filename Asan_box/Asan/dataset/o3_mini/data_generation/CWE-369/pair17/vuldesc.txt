This version contains a divide-by-zero vulnerability (CWE-369). The function that performs
the division uses an unsafe block to compute "dividend / divisor" without any check that the
divisor is non-zero. When a user supplies 0 as the divisor (for instance, as a command-line
argument), the operation will cause a runtime panic, potentially leading to application
instability during concurrent execution.
