This code defines a Calculator struct with a compute method that performs an unsafe division without verifying that the divisor is non-zero. The division occurs inside an unsafe block, and when a zero divisor is used (as shown via concurrent execution using Arc and thread::spawn), it results in a divide-by-zero panic. A public wrapper (safe_compute) is provided to catch panics and convert them into a Result, mimicking an interface used in real-world code where unchecked arithmetic operations occur.
