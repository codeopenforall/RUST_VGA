The vulnerable code defines an arithmetic operation that performs division using an unsafe raw pointer. The critical lines (see line numbers in the lineno tag) directly dereference the pointer and execute the division without verifying that the denominator is non-zero. When a user supplies zero as input, a division-by-zero error occurs, which leads to a runtime panic and potentially exploitable behavior.
