This code suffers from a division by zero vulnerability. The compute function uses an unsafe block to perform division by directly dereferencing a raw pointer to the divisor without checking if it is zero. When a zero divisor is encountered (as in the case of the tuple (50, 0)), the division operation panics, which in a concurrent context can lead to inconsistent execution or crash the entire process.
