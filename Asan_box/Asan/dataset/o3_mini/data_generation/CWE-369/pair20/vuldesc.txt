The vulnerable code executes an arithmetic division using an unsafe block without verifying that the divisor is non-zero. Although the API signature returns a Result, the division operation itself (100 / denominator) does not check for a zero denominator, which leads to a panic (or undefined behavior in unsafe contexts) when a zero value is provided. This mimics real-world issues seen in CWE-369 where unchecked numeric operations result in runtime failures.
