This code exposes a function via an extern "C" interface that is intended to process input data from foreign callers. It contains an unsafe block performing pointer conversion and manipulation. Critically, it then deliberately panics without catching the unwinding process. In a real-world FFI or multithreading context, allowing a panic (an "exception" in other languages) to cross the boundary without proper handling (e.g., via catch_unwind) can result in abnormal termination and undefined behavior. This mimics vulnerabilities documented in CWE-248.
