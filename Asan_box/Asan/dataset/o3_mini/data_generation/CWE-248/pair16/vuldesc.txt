This version spawns a thread that performs an unsafe manipulation of a raw pointer.
After subtracting 10 from an initial value of 10, the resulting value becomes zero.
The code then checks if the value is zero and panics accordingly.
Because the panic occurs inside an unsafe block and the thread’s result is unwrapped without using catch_unwind,
the panic is propagated during the join, resulting in an abnormal termination.
This represents CWE-248 since an exception (panic) is not properly caught and handled, potentially causing unforeseen failures.
