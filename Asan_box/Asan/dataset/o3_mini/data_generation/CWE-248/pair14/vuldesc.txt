This vulnerable code demonstrates CWE-248 by invoking unsafe code that panics on invalid input 
(with a negative value). A thread is spawned without using catch_unwind to intercept panics, 
and a join().unwrap() is used to retrieve the result. If a panic occurs within the thread, the panic 
propagates unhandled, leading to abnormal termination.
