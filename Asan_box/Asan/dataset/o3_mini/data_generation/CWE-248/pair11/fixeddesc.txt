In this fixed implementation, the thread’s closure is wrapped using std::panic::catch_unwind. This ensures that if a panic occurs (triggered by the same condition as in the vulnerable code), it is intercepted rather than propagating and causing an abnormal termination. After catching the panic, the code recovers by modifying the global state (updating the value) to prevent a repeated failure. This approach adheres to the best practices for handling panics safely in concurrent Rust code, thereby mitigating the CWE-248 issue.
