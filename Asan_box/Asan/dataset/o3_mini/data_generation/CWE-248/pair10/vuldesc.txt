The vulnerable code creates a struct implementing a trait with an unsafe method that performs an unchecked integer division. When the thread calls this method with a divisor of zero, a panic is triggered (via division-by-zero). The panic is not caught by any exception handling (e.g., via catch_unwind), causing an abnormal termination when join().unwrap() re-propagates the panic.
