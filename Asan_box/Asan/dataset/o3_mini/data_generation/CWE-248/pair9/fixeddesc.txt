In the corrected code the computation inside the spawned thread is wrapped within a call to panic::catch_unwind.
This ensures that any panic (for example, triggered by a division by zero when input is zero) is intercepted and turned
into an Err value rather than propagating and causing abnormal termination. Additionally, the thread join result is safely
handled without an unguarded unwrap, satisfying the proper handling of exceptions and mitigating CWE-248.
