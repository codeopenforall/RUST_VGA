This vulnerable code simulates a real-world issue analogous to CWE-248. It performs an unsafe operation
within a concurrent thread that checks a condition on shared data and triggers a panic when the condition
is met. The main thread calls join().unwrap() on the spawned thread, meaning that when the thread panics,
the panic is not caught and instead causes abnormal termination of the whole process. This pattern, seen in
several RustSec advisories, can be especially problematic when crossing FFI boundaries or interacting with
untrusted code.
