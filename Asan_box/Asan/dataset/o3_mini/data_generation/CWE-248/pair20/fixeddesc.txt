In the corrected version, the thread's join result is examined rather than unwrapping it directly. By matching on the result of join(),
the code intercepts the panic from the thread and recovers gracefully, logging the incident without letting the panic
propagate unchecked. This ensures stable operation without abnormal termination and addresses the vulnerability from CWE-248.
