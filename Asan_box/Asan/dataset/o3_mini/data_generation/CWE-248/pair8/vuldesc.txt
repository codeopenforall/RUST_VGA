The vulnerable code creates a Handler struct that spawns a thread executing an unsafe block.
Within that block, it dereferences a raw pointer and, upon detecting an unexpected condition (i.e., the value is 0), it triggers a panic.
Since the panic is not caught (using mechanisms like catch_unwind), it propagates through the thread's join operation,
potentially causing abnormal termination of the overall application. This mimics scenarios similar to CAD vulnerability
reports where panics cross FFI or thread boundaries unchecked (CWE-248).
