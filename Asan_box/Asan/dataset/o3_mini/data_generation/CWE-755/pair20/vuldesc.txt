The vulnerable code silently ignores errors when reading and parsing the configuration file by using unwrap_or_default(). 
If the file is missing or contains invalid data, it results in a default factor value of 0. Consequently, any computations 
using this configuration yield an incorrect result (typically 0), leading to subtle logic errors. The use of unsafe blocks 
and concurrency further mimics complex real-world applications where such error masking can hide critical faults.
