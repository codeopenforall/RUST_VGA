The corrected version addresses the vulnerability by properly propagating errors rather than swallowing them. In the update() method, we replace the usage of .unwrap_or_default() with proper error handling using Result propagation. On a parse failure, an error is returned immediately and the configuration is not updated. This ensures that any exceptional condition is made explicit and can be handled by the caller, thereby preserving program integrity. Additionally, the unsafe block is removed in favor of safe Rust constructs for updating the configuration.
