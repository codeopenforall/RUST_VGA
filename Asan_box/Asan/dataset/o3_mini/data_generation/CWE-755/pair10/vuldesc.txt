This vulnerable implementation mishandles exceptional conditions. When attempting to read and parse a configuration file, any error (e.g. file not found or parsing failure) is silently swallowed using unwrap_or_default. As a result, the application falls back to an insecure default value (threshold 0) without alerting the operator, thereby violating the intended invariant and potentially leading to security risks.
