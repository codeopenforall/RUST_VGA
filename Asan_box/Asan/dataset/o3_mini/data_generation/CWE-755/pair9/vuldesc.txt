This code suffers from CWE-755, where exceptional conditions during configuration loading are improperly handled. In particular, instead of propagating parse failures from the configuration file, the code uses unwrap_or_default() to silently substitute a default value. This can result in an insecure configuration, as any malformed or intentionally tampered configuration data will be replaced by defaults without alerting the system or failing fast.
