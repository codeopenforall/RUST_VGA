This snippet demonstrates improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755) in a concurrent context. The configuration loader always returns an error, but instead of propagating the error, the code immediately calls unwrap_or_default() to obtain a default configuration. As a result, the error is silently swallowed and the default (and possibly unsafe) value is used. Additionally, the code employs unsafe pointer manipulation within a threaded context, which could mimic real-world unsafe practices.
