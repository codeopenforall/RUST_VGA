The corrected version addresses the vulnerability by eliminating the use of unwrap_or_default() in favor of proper error handling using expect(). Instead of silently substituting a default configuration when load_config() fails, the code now explicitly panics with an informative message. This ensures that exceptional conditions are not overlooked. The concurrent processing and unsafe pointer manipulation remain to mimic realistic usage, but the central flaw of swallowing errors has been fixed.
