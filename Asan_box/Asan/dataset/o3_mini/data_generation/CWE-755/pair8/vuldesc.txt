This code demonstrates a vulnerability where exceptional conditions are improperly handled.
In scenarios such as an empty dataset, a division-by-zero operation is forced,
but the use of unwrap_or_default() masks the error by returning a default value (0).
This improper swallowing of errors may lead to misleading outputs,
especially in concurrent contexts where unsafe operations further complicate state.
