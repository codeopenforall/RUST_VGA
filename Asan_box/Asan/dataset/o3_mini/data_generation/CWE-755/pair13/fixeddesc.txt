The fixed version addresses the vulnerability by replacing unwrap_or_default() with proper error propagation.
The constructor now returns a Result and uses map_err to capture and forward parsing errors. As a result,
when provided with invalid input (such as "invalid"), the function returns an error rather than a default value.
The improved error handling ensures that exceptional conditions are not silently overlooked, and the program can react appropriately.
Concurrency and unsafe blocks remain for realistic complexity but no longer mask errors.
