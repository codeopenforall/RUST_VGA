In this corrected version, the configuration is loaded using Result-returning functions. The code properly reports errors (e.g. missing or malformed CONFIG_VAL, or a zero value) instead of silently substituting a default. This change prevents unsafe operations like division-by-zero. The use of proper error propagation (and the elimination of unsafe error swallowing via unwrap_or_default) ensures that exceptional conditions are handled explicitly and securely. Notice that the unsafe block has been removed in compute(), and the overall design avoids inadvertent dereferencing of potentially invalid pointers.
