In this corrected version, the function 'analyze' remains unchanged, but the handling of its Result is improved. Instead of using unwrap_or_default—which masks the error—the code uses the '?' operator to propagate the error when the input is empty. This ensures that the exceptional condition is not silently ignored, and the program aborts as expected, conforming to best practices for error handling.
