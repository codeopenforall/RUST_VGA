This version demonstrates a vulnerability in handling exceptional conditions. The load_conf method hides any I/O errors by using .unwrap_or_default() when reading the file,
thereby silently substituting an empty configuration when the file is missing or unreadable. The inclusion of an unsafe block that manipulates a raw pointer further obscures the error flow,
making it easy to overlook failures.
