In the corrected version, the load_conf method has been reworked to explicitly propagate errors encountered during file reading by using the ? operator.
Additionally, the unsafe block and raw pointer usage have been removed, and the configuration is directly assigned.
Thus, if the file cannot be read, an error is returned rather than silently defaulting to an empty configuration.
