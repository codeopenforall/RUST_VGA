The improved version propagates errors rather than suppressing them. 
By replacing unwrap_or_default() with the '?' operator and proper error mapping for parsing issues, 
the code now ensures that any failures during file reading or conversion become visible. 
This prevents the logic from proceeding based on an unintended default value and improves overall robustness, 
especially in concurrent and unsafe operations.
