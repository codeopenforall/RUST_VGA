In this version the configuration loader uses an unsafe block and the method unwrap_or_default() to process a string input. When given an invalid input ("not_a_number"), the parse fails but the error is swallowed, causing the function to return a default value of 0. This leads to an incorrect and unsafe state throughout the program because subsequent computations receive an invalid parameter. Concurrent access using unsafe global pointers further increases the risk.
