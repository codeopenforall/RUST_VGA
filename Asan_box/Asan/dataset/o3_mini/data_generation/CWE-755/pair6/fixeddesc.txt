This version corrects the behavior by propagating errors upon configuration parsing. Instead of using unwrap_or_default(), the function read_config returns a Result type and uses map_err to signal errors. Subsequent calls to retrieve_config and compute properly propagate any error, ensuring that an invalid configuration (such as a non-numeric string) prevents further unsafe operations. This change improves the integrity and security of error handling.
