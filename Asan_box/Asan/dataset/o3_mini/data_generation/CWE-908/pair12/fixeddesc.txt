The fix addresses the use of uninitialized memory by ensuring that the 'public'
field of the Item structure is assigned a value along all code paths. Regardless of the
flag passed to the constructor, the field 'public' is initialized (here, always set to 128).
This guarantees that all arithmetic operations and concurrent accesses use valid, initialized data,
thereby mitigating the CWE-908 vulnerability.
