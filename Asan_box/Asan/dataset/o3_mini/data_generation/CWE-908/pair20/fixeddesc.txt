The corrected version initializes every field in the Config structure. 
After creating uninitialized memory with MaybeUninit, the code explicitly writes to both the 'value' field and the 'message' field (using std::ptr::write for the latter) before calling assume_init. 
This guarantees that no uninitialized memory is accessed, thus permanently mitigating the vulnerability (CWE-908) while preserving the concurrent pattern.
