This code is vulnerable to CWE-088 (OS Command Injection). It unsafely converts a Rust string into a C string pointer without ensuring proper null termination, then embeds untrusted input directly into a shell command that is executed with "sh -c". An attacker can supply a crafted input containing shell metacharacters (e.g., ";", "&&") to inject and execute unintended commands. The use of concurrency and unsafe pointer manipulation mimics real-world unsafe patterns.
