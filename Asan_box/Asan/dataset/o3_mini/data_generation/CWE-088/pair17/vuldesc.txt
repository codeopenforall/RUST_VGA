The vulnerable code unsafely converts a string from a locked Mutex using an unsafe block
and directly injects untrusted input into a shell command string via format!.
This command is then executed with "sh -c", enabling an attacker to inject additional
commands by supplying metacharacters (e.g., semicolons). Additionally, the use of unsafe code
to interpret raw pointers exacerbates the risk by relying on assumptions about string termination.
