This code demonstrates an OS command injection flaw. The function that constructs the shell command uses an unsafe block to reinterpret an input string via raw pointers. The unsanitized input is then interpolated into a shell command string passed to "sh -c". If an attacker provides input containing shell metacharacters (e.g., ";", "&"), additional commands may be executed unintentionally. This vulnerability reflects CWE-088.
