This implementation directly passes unsanitized user input to a shell command using an unsafe block.
Because it converts the input via a raw pointer and uses it in a shell command (via "sh -c"),
an attacker may inject additional commands (e.g., "safe; echo injected").
This mimics a real-world OS command injection flaw reported in CWE-088.
