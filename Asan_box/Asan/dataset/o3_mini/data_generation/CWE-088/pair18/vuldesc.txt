The vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to unsafely dereference a pointer containing user‐provided input. 
It then interpolates that input directly into a shell command string using format! and passes it to "sh -c". 
This leads to CWE-088: OS Command Injection, where shell metacharacters (e.g. ';') in the input can trigger unintended command execution.
