This code uses an unsafe block and constructs a shell command by embedding an untrusted input string directly into a formatted command. The use of "sh -c" causes the command string to be interpreted by an underlying shell, meaning that metacharacters (such as ';') introduced by an attacker may lead to execution of additional, unintended commands. This pattern is representative of real-world OS command injection vulnerabilities (CWE-088) as reported in RustSec advisories.
