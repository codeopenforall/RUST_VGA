This snippet demonstrates a real-world OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-088). The function
prepare a shell command by unsafely concatenating a user-supplied input into a string that is then
passed to "sh -c" within an unsafe block. The misuse of unsafe code along with shell invocation
can allow an attacker to inject malicious shell commands if the input is not properly sanitized.
Concurrent execution using threads and smart pointers further mimics realistic usage patterns.
