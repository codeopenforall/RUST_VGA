This code demonstrates an OS command injection flaw (CWE-088). The untrusted input is formatted into a shell command string without proper sanitization. The use of an unsafe block to execute the command via "sh -c" allows an adversary to inject additional commands (e.g. via semicolon) that are then executed by the system. In addition, unsafe shared state manipulation further amplifies the risk in a concurrent context.
