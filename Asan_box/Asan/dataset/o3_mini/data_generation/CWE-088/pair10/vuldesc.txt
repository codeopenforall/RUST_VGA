This version demonstrates an OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-088). Untrusted input is passed directly into a shell command without proper sanitization. An unsafe block is used to mimic complex real-world unsafe practices (via raw pointer usage and concurrency), leading to unsanitized string interpolation into "sh -c". Attackers can inject arbitrary commands by including shell metacharacters.
