The code above builds a shell command by concatenating an internal configuration string with untrusted user input. The unsafe block is used to reassemble the configuration from its raw pointer, and a new thread is spawned to run the command via "sh -c". Because no sanitization or safe argument handling is performed, an attacker-supplied string (e.g. "hello; echo INJECTED") can inject additional shell commands, leading to CWE-088: OS Command Injection.
