In the corrected code the exceptional condition is properly handled. The call to recv_timeout()
now explicitly matches on the returned error variants. In case of a timeout (or disconnection), 
the function returns an error instead of substituting a default value. This change prevents the unsafe 
block from manipulating an unintended default value and ensures that only a genuine reading is processed.
