The corrected version now properly handles the timeout error. Instead of returning a default value upon a timeout from the channel receive, it propagates an error ("Operation timed out") to the caller. This ensures that exceptional conditions are not mistakenly interpreted as valid successful outcomes. The unsafe block remains for illustrative purposes, maintaining similarity with realistic usage patterns without affecting error propagation.
