The corrected code explicitly distinguishes between the different exceptional conditions by matching against all possible statuses (Success, Failure, Timeout). It only returns a successful result when the operation yields Success. This fixes the vulnerability related to improperly checking error conditions (CWE-754) by ensuring that a Failure is not inadvertently treated as a success. The unsafe block remains for illustration purposes, similar to real-world scenarios where low-level operations are necessary.
