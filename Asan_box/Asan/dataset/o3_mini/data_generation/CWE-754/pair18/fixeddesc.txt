The corrected code propagates the timeout error without attempting to recover from it. 
Instead of checking for a Timeout error and then unsafely reading the shared value, 
the fixed version directly returns the error from the channel, ensuring that exceptional 
conditions are handled correctly. This prevents the scenario where a timeout is misinterpreted as success.
