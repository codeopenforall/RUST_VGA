In the corrected version, the exceptional condition is handled appropriately. Instead of misinterpreting a timeout error by returning a default value, the code now returns an explicit error ("Operation timed out") when the receiver times out. This ensures that the function correctly signals when the asynchronous operation did not complete in the expected timeframe.
