In this corrected implementation, the error handling within the concurrent worker thread is fixed. The code now checks 
explicitly for ErrorKind::TimedOut and returns an error (“operation timed out”) instead of incorrectly treating the error 
as a successful outcome. This proper handling of exceptional conditions prevents the erroneous state update that was present 
in the original version.
