This version is vulnerable because it constructs the external command using a relative path ("plugin_loader"). Without specifying an absolute path, an attacker could place a malicious executable with the same name in a directory earlier in the untrusted search path, leading to DLL preloading or command hijacking vulnerabilities (CWE-426). The code also demonstrates the use of unsafe blocks and concurrency for realistic context.
