This corrected version fixes the vulnerability by using an absolute path ("/usr/local/bin/plugin_loader") when executing an external command. This prevents an attacker from exploiting the untrusted search path issue, guaranteeing that only the intended executable is loaded. The concurrency and unsafe block usage mirror the design of the original code to maintain realistic patterns while resolving the CWE-426 issue.
