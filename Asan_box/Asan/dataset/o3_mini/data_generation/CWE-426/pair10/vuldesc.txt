The code executes an external command using the relative name "ls" without verifying the absolute path. It employs unsafe pointer conversions to obtain the command string from a CString, and concurrently spawns threads to run the command. This pattern is vulnerable because an attacker can manipulate the PATH environment variable (CWE-426) to load a malicious executable instead of the trusted one.
