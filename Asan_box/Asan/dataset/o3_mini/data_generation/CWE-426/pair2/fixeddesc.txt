In this corrected version the vulnerability is mitigated by resolving the absolute file path of the target executable prior to launching it. The resolve_path method determines the directory of the running application and appends the expected executable name. This guarantees that only an executable from a trusted directory is loaded and executed, thus effectively addressing the untrusted search path flaw.
