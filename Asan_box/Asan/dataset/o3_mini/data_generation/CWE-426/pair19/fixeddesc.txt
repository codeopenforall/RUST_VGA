In the corrected implementation, the vulnerability is mitigated by eliminating the dynamic selection of the executable based on untrusted environment input. The function now returns a hardcoded absolute path ("/usr/local/bin/helper_bin"), ensuring that only a known, secure binary is executed. The code still uses an unsafe block and concurrency for realistic system interaction, but the underlying security risk associated with an untrusted search path has been resolved.
