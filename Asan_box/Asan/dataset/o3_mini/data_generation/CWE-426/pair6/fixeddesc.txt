In this corrected version, the vulnerable use of a relative command name has been eliminated by resolving the target 
executable's full absolute path through the function absolute_path(). This prevents the possibility of an attacker 
injecting a malicious binary by manipulating the search path. The rest of the design, including the unsafe block and 
concurrent execution, remains intact to mimic realistic real-world usage patterns in Rust.
