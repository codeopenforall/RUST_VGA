In this corrected version the vulnerability is mitigated by enforcing the use of an absolute path when constructing the command. The Loader struct now initializes its command field with an absolute path ("/usr/bin/example_app") and the run method validates the command path before executing any unsafe code. This prevents an attacker from exploiting the untrusted search path vulnerability.
