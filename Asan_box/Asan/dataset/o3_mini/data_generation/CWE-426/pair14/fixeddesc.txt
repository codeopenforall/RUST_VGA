The corrected code enforces strict validation of the executable path to mitigate CWE-426. The invoke() method now checks that the path begins with "/" (i.e. it is absolute) before proceeding. If a relative (and thus untrusted) path is provided, the function immediately returns an error. This eliminates the risk of an attacker preloading a malicious executable. The overall structure (using Arc, Mutex, and thread spawning) remains to reflect realistic community idioms.
