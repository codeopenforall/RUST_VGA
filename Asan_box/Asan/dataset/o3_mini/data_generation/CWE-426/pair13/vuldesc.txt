This code demonstrates a vulnerability corresponding to CWE-426 by invoking an external executable using a relative path.
An unsafe function converts a CString into a raw pointer and then “executes” it without validating that the command's path is absolute.
Concurrent threads call the loader concurrently, further compounding the unsafe behavior.
If an attacker places a malicious executable named "insecure_app" in an untrusted location, it may be executed.
