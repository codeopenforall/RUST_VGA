The corrected code mitigates CWE-426 by using an absolute path for the external executable (e.g.,
"/usr/bin/dummy_executable" on Unix-like systems or "C:\Trusted\dummy_executable" on Windows). By doing so,
the code avoids inadvertent loading of a malicious executable that might reside in an untrusted search path.
All other logic remains similar, preserving the structure while ensuring the executable is loaded from a trusted location.
