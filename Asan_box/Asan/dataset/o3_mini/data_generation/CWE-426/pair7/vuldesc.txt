This version constructs an application instance using a relative path ("plugin.so") for an external binary. In the concurrent execution within unsafe blocks, a raw pointer conversion is performed on the command string without ensuring that the command identifier is an absolute path. This allows an attacker to influence the untrusted search path (CWE-426) resulting in the possibility of hijacking the execution by placing a malicious binary with the same name in an earlier directory of the system’s PATH.
