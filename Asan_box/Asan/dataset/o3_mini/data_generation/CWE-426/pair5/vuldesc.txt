The above code suffers from an untrusted search path (CWE-426) vulnerability. It constructs an external command using a relative executable name ("untrusted_executable")
without enforcing an absolute path, making it susceptible to DLL preloading or executable hijacking attacks. The use of unsafe blocks along with concurrency 
and dynamic shared ownership (via Arc) further mimics a real-world scenario where low-level system interfacing compounds the risk.
