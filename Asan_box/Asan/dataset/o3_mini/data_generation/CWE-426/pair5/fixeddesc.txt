The corrected version addresses the untrusted search path vulnerability by enforcing that the executable's path is absolute.
In the constructor, if the supplied path is not absolute, the program panics, thereby preventing the inadvertent use of relative paths that might be manipulated.
This design aligns with safer system programming practices and mitigates the risk of DLL preloading and executable hijacking.
