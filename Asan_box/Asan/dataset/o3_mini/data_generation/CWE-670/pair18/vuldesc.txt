The vulnerable code implements an executor that uses an unsafe block to update a shared integer value concurrently.
The core issue lies in the control flow within the process_input method: the match arms are inverted.
When the special flag is true (which should trigger the special behavior by adding 50 to the input),
the code incorrectly multiplies the input by 2. Conversely, when the flag is false,
it erroneously adds 50 instead of multiplying by 2.
This always-incorrect control flow leads to unexpected results and violates the intended algorithm,
triggering CWE-670 (Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation).
