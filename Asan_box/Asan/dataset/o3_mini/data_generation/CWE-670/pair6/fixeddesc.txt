In the corrected version, the calculate function now properly verifies the input index before proceeding. The explicit check (if index < threshold) ensures that any input below the threshold is safely rejected by returning None, and the unsafe block has been removed entirely. This correct control flow eliminates the risk of out-of-bound memory access and aligns with safe Rust idioms, fulfilling the intended behavior without compromising memory safety.
