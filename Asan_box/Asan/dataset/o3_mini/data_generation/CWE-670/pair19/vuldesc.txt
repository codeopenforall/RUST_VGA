The above code suffers from an always-incorrect control flow implementation. In the Task::run method, the match arms are inverted: tasks marked as High priority mistakenly perform addition (returning value+5) rather than multiplication, while Low priority tasks perform multiplication instead of addition. This logical error leads to incorrect computation under concurrent execution.
