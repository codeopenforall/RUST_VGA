The vulnerability in this code arises from improper synchronization handling: using unwrap() directly on a Mutex lock after it may have been poisoned by a thread panic. In this scenario, one thread intentionally panics while holding the mutex lock, poisoning it. Subsequent calls to lock the mutex (in other threads and in main) with unwrap() will then trigger a panic rather than gracefully recovering from the poison. This is a realistic pattern seen in some RustSec/CVE reports where lock poisoning is not handled, leading to denial-of-service conditions.
