The vulnerability arises from improper synchronization in concurrent threads: one thread locks the resources in the order [lock1 then lock2] while the other acquires them in the reverse order [lock2 then lock1]. This inconsistent locking order can lead to a deadlock scenario (CWE-662), where each thread holds one lock and waits indefinitely for the other, effectively freezing the system under certain timing conditions.
