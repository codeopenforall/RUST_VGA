In this corrected implementation, both threads enforce a consistent lock acquisition order by always locking "part1" before "part2". This change eliminates the cyclic wait condition that could lead to a deadlock, and thus resolves the synchronization issue. By maintaining the same order in all threads, the program becomes deterministic and free of the potential concurrency hazard observed previously.
