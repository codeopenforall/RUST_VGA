This code demonstrates a double free vulnerability (CWE-415). The structure "Item" manually allocates an integer on the heap and implements a Clone trait that performs a shallow copy of the raw pointer. As a result, two instances share the same allocation. When both instances are dropped, the first drop successfully frees the memory while the second drop detects that the memory has already been freed (using a global atomic flag) and then panics with "Double free detected", thereby simulating a double free vulnerability.
