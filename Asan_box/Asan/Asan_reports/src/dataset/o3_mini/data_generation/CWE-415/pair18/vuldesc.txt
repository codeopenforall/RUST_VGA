The vulnerability exists because the function that manually releases the resource deallocates the memory without
invalidating its internal pointer. When the instance subsequently goes out of scope, its Drop implementation
deallocates the memory a second time. This double free (CWE-415) can corrupt memory and lead to undefined behavior.
