The above vulnerable version contains a double free flaw (CWE-415). The Manager struct allocates memory manually and then explicitly frees it via the process() method, and later the Drop implementation frees the same memory again. This leads to a double free when both the explicit release and the automatic drop occur, potentially causing undefined behavior or security exploits in real-world environments.
