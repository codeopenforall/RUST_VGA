This code creates a heap-allocated integer wrapped within a structure that holds a raw pointer. The manual disposal function deallocates the memory using an unsafe block but fails to nullify the pointer afterward. Consequently, when the object is dropped, its Drop implementation also attempts to deallocate the same memory. A global atomic counter is used to detect multiple deallocations on the same pointer, resulting in a panic. This mimics a double free vulnerability reported in real-world Rust unsafe usage.
