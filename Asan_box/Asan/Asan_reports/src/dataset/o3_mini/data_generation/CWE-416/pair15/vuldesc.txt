This code demonstrates a use‐after‐free vulnerability by converting a Box to a raw pointer and then freeing the memory while still retaining the pointer. An unsafe block is used to drop the Box (thereby deallocating the memory) and then immediately accessing the memory via the dangling pointer. Concurrent activity is introduced by spawning a thread which may exacerbate memory reuse issues, mimicking realistic undefined behavior scenarios reported in RustSec.
