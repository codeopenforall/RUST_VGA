This vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to perform unchecked wrapping addition on an 8‐bit integer.
When 10 is added to 250, the resulting value wraps around to 4 instead of detecting an overflow.
The design mimics real-world concurrency and unsafe pointer usage found in some RustSec reports,
and it may lead to logic errors in production systems (CWE-190: Integer Overflow/Wraparound).
