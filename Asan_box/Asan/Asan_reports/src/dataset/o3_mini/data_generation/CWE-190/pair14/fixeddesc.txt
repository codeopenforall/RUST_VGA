In this corrected version the computation is made safe by replacing the unchecked multiplication 
with the checked_mul method and verifying that the result does not exceed u16::MAX. If the multiplication 
would overflow or if the product is too large to convert to u16, the function returns an error instead 
of producing an incorrect result. This approach prevents the type cast from silently wrapping the integer 
value.
