This code constructs a data buffer where an off‐by‐one error causes an unsafe length to be set on the internal vector. Specifically, only (size - 1) elements are safely pushed into the vector, but then the unsafe invocation of set_len extends the length to size. Consequently, the final element remains uninitialized, and subsequent operations (such as summing the elements concurrently) lead to undefined behavior.
