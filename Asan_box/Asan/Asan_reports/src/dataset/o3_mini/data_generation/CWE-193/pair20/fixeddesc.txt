The fix corrects the off-by-one error in the load_data function. Instead of accessing src[i+1],
the loop now correctly uses src[i] for each iteration, ensuring that only valid memory is read.
The set_len call is still used to prepare the vector storage, but now the copying of data happens
within the correct bounds. This safe adjustment prevents reading past the allocated slice while preserving
the overall design and concurrency model.
