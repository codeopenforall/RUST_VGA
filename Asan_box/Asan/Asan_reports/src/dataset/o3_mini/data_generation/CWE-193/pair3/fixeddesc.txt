The corrected version fixes the off-by-one vulnerability by creating a slice with a length equal exactly to the size of the
"data" array. This ensures that only the intended elements are processed and that the out-of-bounds memory (the "extra" field)
is not inadvertently read, thereby mitigating the vulnerability.
