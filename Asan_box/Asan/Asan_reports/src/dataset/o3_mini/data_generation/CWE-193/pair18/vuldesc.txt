This version contains an off-by-one error in the function that copies data from a slice into a new vector. Within an unsafe block, each element is copied to a pre-allocated buffer, but the final call to buffer.set_len() mistakenly sets the length to input.len() + 1 rather than input.len(). This error, typical of fencepost mistakes, can result in reading uninitialized memory and potential memory corruption, reflecting CWE-193.
