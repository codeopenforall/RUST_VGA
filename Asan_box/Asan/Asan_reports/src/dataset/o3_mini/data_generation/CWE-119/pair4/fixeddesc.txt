The corrected version adds explicit bounds checking before performing the unsafe memory copy.
It verifies that the destination index plus the number of elements does not exceed the allocated vector length 
and also ensures that the source slice is large enough.
If either check fails, the function returns an error rather than executing the unsafe code,
thereby preventing out‐of‐bounds writes.
