This vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to perform raw pointer arithmetic without bounds checking. The update method directly writes to an address computed with .add(idx) even when idx is outside the valid range (i.e. idx equal to the length of the vector). This improper restriction of operations within memory bounds (CWE-119) can lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior, especially in concurrent or complex systems.
