In this corrected version the unsafe pointer arithmetic has been replaced
by an update method that performs an explicit bounds check before writing into the vector.
If the provided index is not less than the vector’s length, the method returns an error.
This validation prevents any off-by-one or out‐of‐bounds writes, thereby mitigating
the vulnerability (CWE-119) while adhering to safe Rust practices.
