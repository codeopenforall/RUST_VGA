This vulnerable code demonstrates a classic out‐of‐bounds memory error (CWE-119). The memory block is allocated with a size exactly matching the input data. However, an extra write is performed outside of the allocated memory region (writing 99 at the index equal to the length), and the subsequent summing loop iterates one element too many, reading from memory that was not properly allocated. This misuse of unsafe pointer arithmetic can cause memory corruption and unpredictable behavior.
