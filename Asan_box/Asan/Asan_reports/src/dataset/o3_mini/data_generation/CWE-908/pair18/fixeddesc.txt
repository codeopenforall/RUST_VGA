The fixed version properly initializes the entire Config structure by explicitly setting all its fields, including
the description field (desc) with a default value ("default config"). By avoiding the unsafe use of MaybeUninit 
and ensuring that every member is initialized before use, the vulnerability is resolved. The concurrent usage using
Arc remains intact, but now each thread sees a fully initialized resource.
