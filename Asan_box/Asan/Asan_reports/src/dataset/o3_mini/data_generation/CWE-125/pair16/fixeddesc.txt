The corrected code replaces the unsafe memory access with a safe version that uses the slice::get method. This method checks whether the provided index is in bounds before attempting to access the element. If the index is invalid, it uses expect() to provide a clear error message and avoid undefined behavior. This change fully mitigates the CWE-125 vulnerability by ensuring that all accesses are within the allocated memory.
