This implementation exposes an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The structure's retrieval method blindly
accesses an element using an unsafe block with get_unchecked, even when the provided index may exceed the
actual length of the valid slice. For example, passing an index of 3 causes the code to read the fourth memory
slot in a static 4-element array, even though only the first 3 elements are intended for use. This unchecked
access can lead to undefined behavior and potential data leakage.
