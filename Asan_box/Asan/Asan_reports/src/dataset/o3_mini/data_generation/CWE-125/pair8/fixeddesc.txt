In this corrected version the unsafe accessor is replaced by a safe wrapper that first validates the index before performing any pointer arithmetic. Both the internal safe_read method and the public read_value_public method check that the provided index is within bounds. If the index is out-of-range, None is returned thereby eliminating the risk of an out-of-bound read. This pattern of explicit boundary checking before any unsafe operation is a common and recommended idiom in the Rust community.
