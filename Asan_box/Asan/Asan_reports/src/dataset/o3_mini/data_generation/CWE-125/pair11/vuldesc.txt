This implementation defines a Processor struct that holds an Arc-wrapped Vec<i32> and implements a trait Calculation. Its compute method unsafely sums a range of elements from the vector using pointer arithmetic with get_unchecked. There is no validation to ensure that the combination of starting index and count does not exceed the vector’s length. As a result, calling the function with parameters (start = 3, count = 2) on a 4-element vector results in reading beyond the allocated bounds, triggering the CWE-125 out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
