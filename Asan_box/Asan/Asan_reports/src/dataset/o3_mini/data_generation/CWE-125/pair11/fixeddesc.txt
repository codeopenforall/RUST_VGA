In the corrected version, the compute method now returns a Result type instead of a raw i32. Before attempting to sum the values, it first checks whether the range defined by the starting index and count is within the bounds of the vector. If the requested range exceeds the available indices, the function immediately returns an error. By using safe slice access via the get() method (which performs bounds checking), this version eliminates the possibility of an out‐of‐bounds read and thereby fixes the CWE-125 vulnerability.
