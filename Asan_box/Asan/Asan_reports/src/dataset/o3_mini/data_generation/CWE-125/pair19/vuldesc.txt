The code above defines a structure that holds a vector of u32 values and implements a trait to compute a sum of adjacent pairs from the vector using unsafe pointer arithmetic. The vulnerability arises because the for-loop iterates over the full range of indices. When the loop reaches the last valid index, the code attempts to access the element at index len (i+1), which is outside the allocated bounds of the vector. This out-of-bound read constitutes CWE-125 due to unchecked pointer arithmetic.
