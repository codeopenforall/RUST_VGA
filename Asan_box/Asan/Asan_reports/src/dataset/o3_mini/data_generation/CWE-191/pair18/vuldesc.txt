The vulnerable version uses an unsafe block to perform subtraction via a raw mutable pointer without checking for an underflow condition. When subtracting a larger number (10) from a smaller value (5), it causes a wrap‐around integer underflow, mimicking a real-world CWE-191 scenario. The unsafe pointer manipulation alongside concurrent access further emphasizes the realistic risky pattern.
