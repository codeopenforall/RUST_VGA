In this corrected version, the subtraction method has been modified to use Rust's 
checked subtraction API (checked_sub). This method returns an Option, which allows us 
to detect if an underflow would occur. In such a case, the implementation uses unwrap_or(0) 
to assign a safe default value of 0. The unsafe block has been removed so that the code 
remains in the safe Rust domain, ensuring that no unchecked pointer arithmetic is performed.
Concurrent behavior is maintained via Arc and Mutex to mimic real-world usage.
