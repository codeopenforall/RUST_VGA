This code defines a Container struct with a method that unsafely reinterprets its byte vector as three consecutive u32 values without validating
that the vector contains at least 12 bytes. In a concurrent context the unsafe block reads memory beyond the allocated buffer when the payload is too short.
This violates the API precondition for pointer use and results in undefined behavior (CWE-475).
