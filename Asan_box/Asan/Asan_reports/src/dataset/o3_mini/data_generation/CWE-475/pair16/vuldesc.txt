This code exhibits undefined behavior (CWE-475) by violating API preconditions. In the compute() method, the unsafe call to std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping() is performed with a length parameter of src.len() + 1 rather than src.len(). This off-by-one error causes the function to read past the end of the allocated memory for the source vector, potentially leading to buffer over-read and memory corruption. The issue is exacerbated by executing the operation in a separate thread, simulating concurrent execution found in real-world scenarios where such mistakes can go unnoticed.
