The vulnerable code creates a raw pointer based on a boxed slice and then writes
to the pointer without checking that the provided index is within bounds. This 
violates the API precondition for pointer arithmetic and can lead to undefined 
behavior, such as memory corruption. The dangerous write occurs in an unsafe 
block with no boundary verification.
