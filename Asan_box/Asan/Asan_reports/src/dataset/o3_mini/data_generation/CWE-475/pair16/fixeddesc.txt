In this corrected version, the unsafe memory copy operation has been fixed by using the exact number of elements available in the source vector when calling std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(). By replacing src.len() + 1 with src.len(), the code conforms to the API preconditions, thereby preventing any out-of-bound memory access. This ensures that the operation is safe even in a concurrent context.
