The corrected version remedies the race condition by encapsulating the shared state in an Arc<Mutex<Data>>. Each thread obtains the lock before accessing and updating the counter. This ordering ensures that the check-then-act sequence is atomic, eliminating the timing window that previously allowed multiple threads to access the data concurrently. This design follows community idioms for safe concurrent access in Rust.
