This code demonstrates a vulnerability classified under CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion.
A deeply nested tree is processed via a recursively called function that uses unsafe pointer arithmetic.
Without a recursion depth limit, an attacker can supply an input that forces the recursion to proceed
without bounds, eventually triggering a stack overflow. The misuse of unsafe code to iterate over the
vector's internal memory further complicates the scenario.
