The fixed version removes any use of unsafe pointer arithmetic by initializing the vector safely
and using safe Rust methods for updating its elements. When an update is requested at an index
beyond the current length, the vector is resized using the built-in resize() method before
performing the update. This guarantees that any write operation remains within valid bounds, thereby
eliminating the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
