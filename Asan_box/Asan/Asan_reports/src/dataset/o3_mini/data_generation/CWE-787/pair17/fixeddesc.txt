In this corrected version, the fill_data method has been adjusted to only iterate
over valid indices of the underlying vector (using a range 0..n instead of 0..=n).
This ensures that no out‐of‐bounds write occurs and the vector’s length remains unchanged.
By removing the unsafe extension of the vector length, the code now adheres to proper bounds
checking and prevents the vulnerability.
