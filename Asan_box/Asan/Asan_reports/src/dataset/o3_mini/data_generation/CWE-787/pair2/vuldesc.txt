This code contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. In the update() method, an unsafe block performs pointer arithmetic without verifying that the specified index is within the bounds of the allocated vector. When update(15, 55) is invoked on a buffer of size 10, it writes past the end of the allocation, which can corrupt memory and is representative of real-world vulnerabilities documented under CWE-787.
