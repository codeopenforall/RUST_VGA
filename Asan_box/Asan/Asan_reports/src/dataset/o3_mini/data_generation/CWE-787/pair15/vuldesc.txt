The code above creates a DataBuffer with a vector that is unsafely set to a specified length
using set_len, even though the memory is not fully initialized. The update() method uses an unsafe
pointer arithmetic to write to the buffer without ensuring that the index is within the allocated
range. This may allow an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787), leading to memory corruption.
