In this corrected version the allocation size is properly computed using input.len(), which returns the
actual number of bytes in the string. This ensures that the memory allocated is sufficient to store the entire
string contents, avoiding buffer underallocation and subsequent memory corruption. The copy operation now transfers
the full content as intended, thereby eliminating the vulnerability.
