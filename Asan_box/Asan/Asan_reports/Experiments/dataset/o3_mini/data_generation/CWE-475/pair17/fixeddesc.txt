In this corrected version the aggregate method properly constructs a slice using the given valid length.
It calls std::slice::from_raw_parts with self.len, ensuring that only the intended memory is read.
This fix satisfies the API preconditions and prevents undefined behavior resulting from an out‐of‐bounds
access.
