The vulnerability arises from providing a length value that exceeds the actual allocation size when converting a raw pointer into a slice. By using an incorrect length (here, valid_data.len() + 10), the unsafe conversion via std::slice::from_raw_parts violates the API precondition. This may lead to out-of-bounds memory reads, undefined behavior, and potential security issues consistent with CWE-475.
