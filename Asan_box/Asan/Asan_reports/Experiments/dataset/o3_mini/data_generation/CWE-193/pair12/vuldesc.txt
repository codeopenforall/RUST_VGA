This vulnerable implementation contains an off-by-one error (CWE-193) in the populate method. The for loop uses "0..=self.data.len()", causing an extra iteration and writing beyond the allocated bounds of the vector via an unsafe unchecked index. This dangerous fencepost mistake, compounded by the use of unsafe code, may lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption in multithreaded contexts.
