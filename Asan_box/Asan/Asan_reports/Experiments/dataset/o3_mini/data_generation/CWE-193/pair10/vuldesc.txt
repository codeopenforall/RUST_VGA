This vulnerable implementation employs an unsafe memory copy to duplicate the contents of an input slice into a vector with preallocated capacity. The flaw arises when the length of the vector is set using an off-by-one error (input.len() - 1) rather than the correct value (input.len()). Consequently, the last byte of the input data is omitted. In concurrent execution contexts, such fencepost mistakes can lead to subtle logic errors that compromise the application’s correctness.
