In this corrected version the initialization loop has been adjusted to populate the vector with exactly 'size' elements, thereby eliminating the need for unsafe manipulation. The removal of the off‐by‐one mistake ensures that every element is properly initialized before use. Consequently, the summing operation yields predictable and correct results, even when accessed concurrently.
