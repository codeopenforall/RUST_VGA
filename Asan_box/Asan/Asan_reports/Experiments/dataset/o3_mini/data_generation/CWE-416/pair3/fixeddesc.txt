The fixed code eliminates the use-after-free issue by employing the Rust smart pointer Arc. Instead of transferring a raw pointer to a global location and using it after freeing the memory, the code wraps the Data in an Arc. Cloning the Arc ensures that the Data remains valid until all users have dropped their references. As a result, the concurrent access by the thread remains safe and predictable.
