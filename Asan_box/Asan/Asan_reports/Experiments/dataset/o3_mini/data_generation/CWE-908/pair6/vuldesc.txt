This example demonstrates a resource initialization vulnerability (CWE-908) where a configuration object is only partially initialized. Specifically, the second field of the Config struct is left uninitialized within an unsafe block using MaybeUninit. When the uninitialized field is later read (in a concurrent context), it produces undefined and unpredictable behavior. This mimics realistic scenarios where unsafe code and improper initialization can lead to security issues.
