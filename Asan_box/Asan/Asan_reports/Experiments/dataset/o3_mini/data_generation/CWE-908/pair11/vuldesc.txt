This code demonstrates a serious vulnerability where a Settings object is allocated 
using a MaybeUninit container but is never properly initialized. The unsafe function 
calls assume_init() on uninitialized memory, leading to undefined behavior. In a 
concurrent scenario, sharing this uninitialized configuration via smart pointers (Arc) 
intensifies the risk, making it a realistic example of CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized 
Resource) as observed in real-world RustSec reports.
