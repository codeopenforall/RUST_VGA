The corrected version eliminates the use of uninitialized memory by introducing a safe constructor that fully initializes the Data structure. The shared resource is properly configured before any threads access it, ensuring that all concurrent consumers see a consistent and valid state. This removes the race condition present in the vulnerable code and adheres to safe concurrency practices in Rust.
