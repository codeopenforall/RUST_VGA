This code demonstrates a concurrency vulnerability related to the use of uninitialized memory. A shared Data instance is created using an unsafe constructor that does not properly initialize its field "value". A secondary thread is spawned to read this uninitialized value while the main thread attempts to initialize it afterward. This race condition leads to undefined behavior, as the reading thread might observe a garbage value rather than the intended value (100). The vulnerability is consistent with CWE-908, where resources (in this case, the Data object) are used before they are fully initialized.
