This code contains an unsafe retrieval function that bypasses bounds checking by using raw pointer arithmetic (as_ptr().add(idx)).
When the index computed (in this example, i * 2) exceeds the vector’s length, the unsafe block reads memory out-of-bound,
potentially leaking arbitrary data or causing undefined behavior.
