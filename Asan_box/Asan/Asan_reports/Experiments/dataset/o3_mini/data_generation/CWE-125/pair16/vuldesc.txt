The vulnerable code uses an unsafe block in the fetch method to read a byte from a fixed buffer using get_unchecked. No bounds checking is performed on the index, so if an out-of-range index is provided (for example, position 5 or higher when the buffer length is 5), it will result in undefined behavior and potential memory corruption. This mimics a CWE-125 (Out-of-Bounds Read) vulnerability reported in real-world scenarios.
