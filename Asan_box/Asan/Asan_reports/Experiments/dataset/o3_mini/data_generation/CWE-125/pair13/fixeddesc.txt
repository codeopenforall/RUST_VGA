In this corrected implementation the compute method first checks that the addition of the starting index and the requested count does not exceed the length of the underlying data slice. If the request would be out-of-bound, the function panics with an informative message. Otherwise, it creates a safe slice using Rust’s range indexing which performs the necessary runtime bounds checking, thereby preventing undefined behavior.
