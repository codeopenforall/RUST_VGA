The above code implements a recursive descent parser that builds an abstract syntax tree from a nested parenthesis string.
It leverages an unsafe block to simulate real-world low-level pointer manipulations.
However, the recursion is uncontrolled and lacks a depth limit—if the input has excessive nested parentheses,
this code will overflow the stack, leading to denial-of-service conditions. This mimics CWE-674 where unbounded recursion is exploited.
