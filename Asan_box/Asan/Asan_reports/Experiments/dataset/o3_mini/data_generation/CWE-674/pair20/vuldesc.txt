The vulnerable code implements a recursive descent parser that processes a string containing expressions with parentheses.
It directly recurses on encountering an opening parenthesis with no control on the recursion depth (see the recursive call on line 14).
This uncontrolled recursion exposes the program to a potential stack overflow when processing deeply nested inputs.
Unsafe blocks are used to perform unchecked byte array accesses, further mimicking common patterns in real-world unsafe Rust code.
