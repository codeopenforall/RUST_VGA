This vulnerable implementation performs recursive descent parsing using an unsafe block without enforcing any recursion depth limit. As a result, attacker-supplied input with extreme nesting (e.g. a long sequence of '(' characters) can trigger uncontrolled recursion, eventually leading to a stack overflow. The lack of boundary checks in the recursive function (specifically at the recursive call site) makes this code susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.
