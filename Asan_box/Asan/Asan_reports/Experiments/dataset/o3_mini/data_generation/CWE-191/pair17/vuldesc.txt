The vulnerability occurs because the subtraction method uses an unsafe block with raw pointer arithmetic to subtract a value without verifying that the operation will not underflow. When the stored value is 0 and 1 is subtracted, the operation wraps around to 4294967295 (for u32) in release mode, or may panic in debug mode. This represents a classic CWE-191 (Integer Underflow) issue.
