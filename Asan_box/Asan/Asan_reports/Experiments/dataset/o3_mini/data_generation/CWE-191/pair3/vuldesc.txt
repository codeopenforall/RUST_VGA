The above vulnerable code subtracts an amount from the account balance without validating that the balance is sufficient. 
Specifically, the unsafe function "subtract_unchecked" uses raw pointer dereferencing to perform a wrapping subtraction, 
allowing an underflow (CWE-191) when subtracting 1 from 0. Concurrent accesses through a Mutex mask the defect.
