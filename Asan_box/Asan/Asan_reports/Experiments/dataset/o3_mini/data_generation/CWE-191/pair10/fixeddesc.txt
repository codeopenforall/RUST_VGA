In this corrected version the withdraw function has been modified to avoid integer underflow by using saturating subtraction (saturating_sub). This ensures that if the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance, the value will be clamped to 0 rather than wrapping around. The overall structure, including concurrency and unsafe access of the inner value, remains similar, making the fix realistic in the context of existing usage patterns while mitigating the CWE-191 vulnerability.
