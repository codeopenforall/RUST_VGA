The corrected version fixes the double free vulnerability by transferring ownership control
into a shared Arc-protected Mutex holding an Option for the raw pointer. Instead of having the
concurrent thread erroneously free the memory, it merely reads the value. The deallocation
is exclusively handled in the Drop implementation (via take() to guarantee single free). This
ensures that only one free operation is performed on the resource even in a concurrent context.
