The revised implementation introduces an Owner struct to manage the allocated heap memory.
The Owner::release method safely frees the memory and nullifies the internal pointer,
ensuring that the memory is deallocated exactly once. The Drop trait further guarantees
that no double free occurs if release has already been called.
