In the corrected implementation, unsafe conversions and insecure checks have been removed. The authentication function now performs a safe,
direct comparison between the provided token and the stored secret. The backdoor token ("test") and the length-based bypass have been eliminated,
ensuring that only an exact match to "SuperSecretPassword" is accepted.
