In this corrected version, the authentication function "verify" has been fixed by replacing the
unsafe pointer arithmetic with a straightforward and safe string equality check. The full token is 
compared against the expected value "secret", eliminating the vulnerability where only a prefix of 
the token was being validated. The concurrent and structural aspects of the code remain unchanged,
ensuring realistic simulation of a multi-threaded authentication scenario.
