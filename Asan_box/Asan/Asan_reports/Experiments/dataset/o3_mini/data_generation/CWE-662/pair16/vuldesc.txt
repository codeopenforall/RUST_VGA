This implementation suffers from CWE-287 Improper Authentication. The authentication check
is insufficient because it uses an unsafe block to compare only the first byte of the stored and
supplied tokens. An attacker can provide a token (e.g., "v") that mimics the first character of
the valid token ("valid_token123") to bypass authentication.
