This vulnerable code suffers from CWE-287 (Improper Authentication) as it mistakenly treats the hardcoded
bypass credential ("test_key") as valid. The unsafe block used for byte‐wise comparison is acceptable,
but the unconditional acceptance of "test_key" creates an authentication flaw that an attacker could exploit.
Additionally, the use of unsynchronized shared state combined with unsafe pointer arithmetic mimics patterns
seen in real-world vulnerabilities.
