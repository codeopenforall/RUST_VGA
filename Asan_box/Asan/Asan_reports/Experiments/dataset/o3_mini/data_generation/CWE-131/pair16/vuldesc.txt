The vulnerability here is caused by an incorrect calculation of the buffer size in the constructor of Data, where std::mem::size_of_val is mistakenly used on the reference to the input string. This returns the size of the reference (typically 16 bytes on 64-bit systems) rather than the actual length of the UTF-8 string. Consequently, if the input string exceeds that size, only a truncated portion is allocated and copied. This error is representative of CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size).
