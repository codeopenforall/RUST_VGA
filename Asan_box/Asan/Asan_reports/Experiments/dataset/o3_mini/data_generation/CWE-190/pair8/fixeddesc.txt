The corrected code adds an explicit runtime check for overflow after performing the multiplication. Before converting the u64 product back to a u32, it verifies whether the product exceeds u32::MAX. If an overflow is detected, an error is returned instead of allowing a silent wrap-around. This modification ensures that any arithmetic overflow is caught reliably, even under concurrent execution.
