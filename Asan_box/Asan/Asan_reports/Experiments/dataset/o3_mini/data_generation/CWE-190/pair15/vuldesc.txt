The vulnerable code computes the total allocation size by converting operands to u32 within an unsafe block and using wrapping multiplication. When the product exceeds the maximum value of u32, it wraps around, leading to an underestimated allocation size. This miscalculation may result in out‐of‐bounds memory writes by the concurrent buffer fill, exposing a CWE-190 Integer Overflow vulnerability.
