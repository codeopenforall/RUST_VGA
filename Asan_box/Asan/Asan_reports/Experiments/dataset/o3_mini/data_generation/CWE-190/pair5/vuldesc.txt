This code employs an unsafe block to perform multiplication by casting the operands to a wider type (u64) and then truncating the result back to u32. When the product of 50000 and 100000 exceeds the maximum capacity of u32, the conversion silently wraps around, producing an incorrect result. This unchecked arithmetic operation exemplifies CWE-190 (Integer Overflow) by permitting an overflow condition without detection.
