This code implements a ledger update routine where a deposit is multiplied by a constant factor (3) inside an unsafe block. The multiplication is first performed as a u64 calculation, and then its result is cast back to a u32 without checking whether the value exceeds the maximum for u32. This can lead to an integer overflow (wraparound) when processing large deposit amounts, causing an incorrect ledger total (CWE-190).
