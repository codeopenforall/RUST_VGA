The corrected code removes the unsafe unchecked multiplication and instead uses Rust’s checked_mul method to detect overflow. It also adjusts the concurrency pattern: rather than having threads update a shared state unsafely, the threads independently return their values, which are then combined sequentially using safe arithmetic operations. When an overflow is detected, the function returns an error. This fix addresses CWE-190 by ensuring arithmetic operations do not overflow silently.
