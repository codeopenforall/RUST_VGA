The revised version prevents the out-of-bound write by checking if the input length exceeds the buffer capacity before performing any unsafe memory operations. In the "load" function, if the input length is greater than the allocated capacity (10 bytes), an error is returned rather than performing the copy. This fix adheres to safe Rust practices and eliminates the possibility of memory corruption.
