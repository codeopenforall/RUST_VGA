This vulnerable code creates a Buffer by unsafely setting the length of a Vec without initializing its elements. It then uses an unsafe write function (store) that performs an unchecked write using get_unchecked_mut. In the run method of Worker, it deliberately writes to an index equal to the Vec’s length, causing an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). This mimics real-world vulnerabilities reported in RustSec, where unsafe pointer arithmetic and set_len misuse can lead to memory corruption.
