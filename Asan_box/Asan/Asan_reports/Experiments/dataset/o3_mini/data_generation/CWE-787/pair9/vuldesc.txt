This code demonstrates an out‐of‐bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787). The process method writes elements of an input slice directly into a vector’s memory using unsafe pointer arithmetic. It sets the vector’s length to the input length without checking whether the input exceeds the allocated capacity (which is fixed to 10). When an input of 11 elements is processed, the loop writes beyond the vector’s allocated memory, corrupting adjacent memory. This pattern (unchecked pointer arithmetic, misuse of set_len, and concurrency) reflects realistic issues observed in RustSec advisories.
