This version exhibits a CWE-787 vulnerability via an out-of-bounds write.
Specifically, the buffer is created with a capacity for 10 elements but its length is
erroneously set to 11 (line 8). The unsafe block in the update method (line 18) writes to
index 10 without validating the index, leading to undefined behavior that can corrupt memory.
The concurrency introduced via a spawned thread further complicates the unsafe access.
