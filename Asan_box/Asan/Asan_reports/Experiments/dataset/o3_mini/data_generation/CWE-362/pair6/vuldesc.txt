This vulnerable code features a race condition (CWE-362) caused by concurrent unsynchronized access to a shared counter.
The method responsible for incrementing the counter uses an unsafe block to perform a read-modify-write operation without any locking mechanism.
Multiple threads increment the counter concurrently, which can lead to lost updates and an incorrect final count.
