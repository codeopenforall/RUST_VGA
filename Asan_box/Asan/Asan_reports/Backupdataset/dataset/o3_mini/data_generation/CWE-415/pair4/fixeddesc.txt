The corrected implementation removes the second, erroneous conversion of the raw pointer back to a Box.
Only one Box instance is created, ensuring that the resource is deallocated only once. This change prevents
the double free vulnerability while preserving the intended functionality. The use of a static AtomicBool in the
Drop implementation remains as an additional safeguard.
