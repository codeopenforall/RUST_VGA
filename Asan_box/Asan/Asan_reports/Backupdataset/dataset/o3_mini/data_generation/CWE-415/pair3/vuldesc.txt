This code allocates a resource on the heap and converts it to a raw pointer. It then unsafely deallocates the resource by reconstructing a Box from the raw pointer in an unsafe block. However, the same pointer is deallocated twice: first successfully and then again, which triggers a double free detection (using a global AtomicBool) that causes a panic. The double free vulnerability stems from invoking the unsafe deallocation twice on the same memory.
