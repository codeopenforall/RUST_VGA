In the corrected code the double free is prevented by clearing the pointer
after manual deallocation. Specifically, after Box::from_raw is called in the
manual_drop function, the pointer is set to null. During the Drop implementation,
the check for a non-null pointer ensures that no further attempt to free the memory
occurs. This pattern prevents the double free vulnerability and follows community
idioms for safely interfacing with unsafe code.
