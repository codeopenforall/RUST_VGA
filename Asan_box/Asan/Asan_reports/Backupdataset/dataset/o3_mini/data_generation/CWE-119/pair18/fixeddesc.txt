In the corrected code the extra out‐of‐bounds write has been removed. The memory block is
allocated exactly based on the input length, and both copying and summing operations strictly
iterate over the valid indices. This fix prevents any invalid memory access and ensures that
operations are performed within the allocated bounds.
