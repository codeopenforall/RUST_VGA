The corrected code adds an explicit boundary check before performing the memory copy. If the input slice length exceeds the capacity of the fixed buffer (16 bytes), the function immediately returns an error ("Input too large") instead of proceeding. This prevents the unsafe block from writing beyond the allocated memory, thus mitigating the out-of-bound access vulnerability (CWE-119). The remainder of the logic (the unsafe copy and subsequent sum calculation) is only executed when it is guaranteed to be safe.
