This code suffers from an off‐by‐one error in its unsafe memory operations. In the fill method, the loop iterates from 0 up to and including the logical size (i.e. 0..=size),
therefore writing one byte past the intended boundary into a sentinel slot. This improper memory access can corrupt adjacent memory regions,
mimicking real-world vulnerabilities reported for CWE-119.
