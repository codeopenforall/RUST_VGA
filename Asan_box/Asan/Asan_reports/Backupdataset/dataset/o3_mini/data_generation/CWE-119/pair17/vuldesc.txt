The above vulnerable code defines a Buffer struct that allocates an array of bytes. Its method copy_from uses an unsafe block and pointer arithmetic to copy data from an input slice into the buffer. However, it mistakenly writes each byte starting at an offset of one (using dest.add(i+1)), causing the first element of the buffer to remain unchanged and, in the final iteration, writing one element past the allocated memory bounds. This improper memory operation violates the bounds checks and reflects CWE-119.
