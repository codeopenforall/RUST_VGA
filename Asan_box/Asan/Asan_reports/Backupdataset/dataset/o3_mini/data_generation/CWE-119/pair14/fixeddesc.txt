The corrected code replaces unsafe pointer arithmetic with safe operations. It uses a Vec ensuring dynamic indexing, 
augmented by explicit bounds checks before writing and during summation. Out-of-bound accesses are effectively ignored, 
thereby preventing memory corruption in both single-threaded and concurrent contexts.
