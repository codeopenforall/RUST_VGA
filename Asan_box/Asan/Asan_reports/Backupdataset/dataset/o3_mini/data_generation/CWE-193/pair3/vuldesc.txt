This implementation suffers from a fencepost error (CWE-193) by constructing an unsafe slice with a length equal to the array length plus one.
It unintentionally extends the slice beyond the bounds of the intended array "data", causing the extra field ("extra") to be
included in the summation. This off-by-one miscalculation can lead to unintended leaks of data or memory corruption.
