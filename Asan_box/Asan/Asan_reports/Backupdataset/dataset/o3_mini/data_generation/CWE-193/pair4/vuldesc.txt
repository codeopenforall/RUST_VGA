The code above contains an off-by-one error in its unsafe block. When setting the vector's length and populating it in the loop, the index range is defined as 0..=size which causes one extra iteration that writes past the allocated memory. This fencepost error (CWE-193) could lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption in real-world scenarios.
