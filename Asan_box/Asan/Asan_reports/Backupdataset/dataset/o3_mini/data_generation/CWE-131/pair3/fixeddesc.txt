The corrected version determines the proper buffer size by using input.len() to measure exactly how many bytes are needed. It then adds one extra byte to reserve space for a null terminator, ensuring that the unsafe memory copy operation remains within bounds. This fix prevents buffer overflows and aligns with proper memory calculation practices.
