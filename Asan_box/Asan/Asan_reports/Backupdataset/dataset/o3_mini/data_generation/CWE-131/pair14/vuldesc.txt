In this snippet, the processing function incorrectly calculates the number of bytes to copy by using mem::size_of_val(&input), which returns the size of the &str fat pointer rather than the actual byte length of the string. On a 64‐bit system this typically yields 16 bytes regardless of the real string length. As a consequence, when a longer string is provided, only a portion of it is copied into the buffer. This mimics CWE-131 by potentially leading to buffer truncation and undefined behavior.
