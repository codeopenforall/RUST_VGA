This snippet incorrectly calculates the buffer size by using mem::size_of_val(&input), which returns the size of the fat pointer (typically 16 bytes on a 64‐bit system) rather than the true length of the string (input.len()). As a result, the unsafe copy operation may either read beyond the actual data or include uninitialized bytes, causing the resulting String to differ from the original input. Such a mistake constitutes CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size) by ignoring the actual byte-length or necessary terminator adjustments.
