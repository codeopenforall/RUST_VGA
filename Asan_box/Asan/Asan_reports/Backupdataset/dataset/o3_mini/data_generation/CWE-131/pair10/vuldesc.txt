This code contains a vulnerability where the duplicate method (replicate) miscalculates the necessary
buffer size by using std::mem::size_of::<&str>() instead of the actual length of the input string.
Since size_of::<&str>() returns the size of a pointer (typically 16 bytes on 64‐bit systems),
when the input string is shorter (or longer) than that value the unsafe copy operation reads either
too much or too little data from the source. This results in undefined behavior, potentially causing
memory corruption or producing an incorrect string result.
