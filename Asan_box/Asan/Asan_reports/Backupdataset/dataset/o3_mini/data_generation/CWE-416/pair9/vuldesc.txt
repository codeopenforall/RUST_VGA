This Rust program illustrates a use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416). The structure “Processor” allocates
memory for a u32 value using Box and stores its raw pointer. In the execute() function, a local instance of Processor
is created and its internal pointer captured, but once the instance goes out of scope, its Drop implementation frees
the allocated memory. Later, the program unsafely dereferences the stale pointer (in an unsafe block) resulting in
undefined behavior. The pattern mimics real-world unsafe code issues found in RustSec reports.
