The fixed version eliminates the use-after-free vulnerability by replacing the raw pointer with an
Rc (reference-counted smart pointer). In this design, both the creator and the handler share ownership
of the data. The data remains valid until all references are dropped, so the handler's access is safe.
This pattern follows community idioms for safe shared data access in Rust.
