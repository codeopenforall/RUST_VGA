This code incorrectly performs an unchecked subtraction on the wallet's balance within an unsafe block.
By subtracting an amount (20) greater than the current balance (10) without bounds checking,
the arithmetic operation underflows, wrapping the value around and corrupting the account state.
Such behavior is indicative of CWE-191 (Integer Underflow).
