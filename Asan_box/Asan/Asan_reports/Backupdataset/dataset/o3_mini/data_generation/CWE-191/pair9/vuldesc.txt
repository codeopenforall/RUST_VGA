The implementation above suffers from CWE-191 (Integer Underflow) where subtracting 1 
from 0 (an unsigned 32-bit integer) leads to a wraparound to u32::MAX. The code 
uses an unsafe block to perform pointer arithmetic, bypassing Rust's normal safety 
checks, and does not verify whether the subtraction would result in an underflow. 
Due to this vulnerability, concurrent use of this method can lead to critical logic 
errors in real-world applications.
