In the corrected code, the subtraction method checks whether the input value is negative.
If a negative value is detected, the method returns early, thereby avoiding an unsafe cast
and the subsequent underflow. This change prevents the vulnerability while leaving the API
and concurrent structure unaltered, ensuring that legitimate non-negative subtractions work
as intended.
