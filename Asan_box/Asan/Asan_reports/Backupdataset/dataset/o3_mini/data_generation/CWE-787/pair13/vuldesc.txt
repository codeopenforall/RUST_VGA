This code demonstrates a CWE-787 vulnerability via an out-of-bounds write. In the unsafe method "load", the code copies input bytes into a buffer without checking if the input length exceeds the allocated capacity (10 bytes). Consequently, if a triggering input longer than 10 bytes (e.g. 12 bytes) is provided, the unsafe pointer arithmetic results in writing outside the valid memory range and setting an incorrect length via set_len, causing memory corruption.
