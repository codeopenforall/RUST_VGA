In the corrected version the unsafe block is removed in favor of safe Rust practices. The update() method now iterates only up to the vector’s length, and accesses the vector elements using safe indexing. As a result, the vector’s internal length remains consistent with its allocated memory, preventing out-of-bound writes and maintaining proper memory safety in concurrent contexts.
