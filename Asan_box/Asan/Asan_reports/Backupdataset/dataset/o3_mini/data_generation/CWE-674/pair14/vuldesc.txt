This code suffers from an uncontrolled recursion vulnerability (CWE-674) in its recursive descent parser. The function process() recursively calls itself to remove one pair of surrounding parentheses without any depth limitation. An attacker could craft an input consisting of a very high number of nested parentheses to cause a stack overflow. The inclusion of an unsafe block mimics low-level pointer operations often seen in real-world RustSec reports.
