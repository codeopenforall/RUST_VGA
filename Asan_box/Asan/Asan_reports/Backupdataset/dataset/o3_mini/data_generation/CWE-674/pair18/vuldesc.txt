The vulnerability in this code is uncontrolled recursion (CWE-674). The parse_helper function recursively processes 
nested input without imposing a maximum recursion depth. Additionally, the use of unsafe pointer dereferencing with 
get_unchecked compounds the risk. Attackers may supply deeply nested input (e.g., tens of thousands of nested parentheses) 
to trigger a stack overflow, leading to a denial of service.
