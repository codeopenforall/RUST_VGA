The corrected code introduces a recursion depth counter into the traversal function. By passing a current depth and comparing it against a predefined MAX_DEPTH, the function aborts recursion and returns None when the limit is exceeded. This change prevents the uncontrolled recursion issue that could lead to a stack overflow. Although the code retains an unsafe block with pointer arithmetic for realism, the risk is mitigated by enforcing a safe recursion depth.
