This code instantiates a structure that wraps a vector and provides a method to read an element by index using an unsafe pointer arithmetic operation (via add) without verifying bounds. By passing an out-of-bound index (equal to the vector length), the unsafe block performs a read beyond the allocated memory (CWE-125). Concurrency is introduced by spawning a thread that invokes the read, mimicking realistic multi-threaded environments.
