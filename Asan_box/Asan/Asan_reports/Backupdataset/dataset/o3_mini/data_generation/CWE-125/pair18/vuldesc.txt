This code unsafely performs an out‐of‐bounds read on a buffer by using unchecked pointer arithmetic inside an unsafe block. The method “extract” directly computes the address with “ptr.add(index)” without verifying that the provided index is within the bounds of the underlying vector. The issue is compounded by concurrent execution using threads, mimicking patterns seen in real-world vulnerabilities (CWE-125) reported in RustSec. Such an access can lead to undefined behavior or expose sensitive memory.
