The vulnerability exists because the method that retrieves an element uses unsafe pointer arithmetic (ptr.add(index))
without any bounds checking. When an index equal to or exceeding the length of the internal vector is requested,
the code reads memory that is not owned by the vector. This out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) can lead to undefined behavior,
including potential information disclosure or crashes. The use of concurrency (via threads) further emulates a real-world
scenario where such unsafe access might be triggered unexpectedly.
