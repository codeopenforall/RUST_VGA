This code defines a Calculator that performs arithmetic using an unsafe block. The vulnerability arises from an unchecked cast from a u32 to an i32. When a large unsigned integer such as 0xFFFF_FFFF is provided, the conversion truncates the value (resulting in -1) leading to an integer underflow/overflow in the subsequent multiplication and addition. In a multithreaded context, this unsafe arithmetic can corrupt the computed balance.
