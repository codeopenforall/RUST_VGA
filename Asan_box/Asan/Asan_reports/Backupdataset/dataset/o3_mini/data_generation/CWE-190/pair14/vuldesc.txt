The above code is vulnerable to an integer overflow. The unsafe block in the calculate method multiplies 
the input by a factor and then casts the 64-bit result to a 16-bit integer. When the product (e.g., 140000 
for input=70000 and factor=2) exceeds u16::MAX, the cast truncates the value causing wraparound, leading 
to an incorrect and potentially exploitable computation. Concurrency adds additional uncertainty in real-world 
applications.
