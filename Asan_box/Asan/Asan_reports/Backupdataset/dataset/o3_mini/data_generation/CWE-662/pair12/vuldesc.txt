This vulnerable code implements two shared resources protected by Mutexes managed with Arc. The two spawned threads acquire locks in different orders: the first locks resource A then B, while the second locks resource B then A. This inconsistent lock ordering can result in a deadlock if, for instance, thread 1 holds A and waits for B while thread 2 holds B and waits for A. Unsafe blocks are employed in both threads to manipulate the underlying data, mimicking common unsafe practices found in real-world vulnerabilities.
