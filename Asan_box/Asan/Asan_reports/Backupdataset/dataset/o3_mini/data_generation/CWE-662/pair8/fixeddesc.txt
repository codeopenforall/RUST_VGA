The corrected code eliminates the unsafe unsynchronized read in the finalize method by locking the second mutex properly. This ensures that both fields are read consistently, thus avoiding data races or inconsistent state. By removing the unsafe block and using proper locking on both shared values, the synchronization issue is fixed and the aggregate value reflects the expected result.
