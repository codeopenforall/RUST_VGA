This code exhibits an improper synchronization issue. Two threads acquire locks on two different mutexes in opposite orders: one thread locks “lock1” then “lock2” while the other locks “lock2” then “lock1”. In addition, the code unsafely extracts raw pointers from the guarded data and then uses them for updates outside of the critical section. Such misuse of unsafe code in combination with inconsistent locking can lead to deadlocks or data races, emulating real-world issues noted in vulnerabilities like CWE-662.
