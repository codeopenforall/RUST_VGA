In the corrected version, a helper function (safe_lock) is introduced to properly handle the case of a poisoned mutex. Instead of calling unwrap(), safe_lock() recovers the inner shared resource by converting a PoisonError into a usable MutexGuard. This change ensures that even if a thread panics and poisons the lock, subsequent accesses can continue safely, thereby mitigating the synchronization vulnerability present in the original implementation.
