In this corrected version, the transfer function checks that the computed copy length (source length
plus 10) does not exceed the size of the destination buffer or the length of the source slice. By
validating the preconditions before calling the unsafe function, we prevent the undefined behavior
caused by out‐of‐bounds memory access. The concurrency model remains unchanged, but now errors are
properly propagated using Result types.
