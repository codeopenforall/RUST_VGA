The vulnerability arises from performing unchecked pointer arithmetic in an unsafe block. The function calculates an offset of 1 from the input slice’s pointer and creates a subslice with length (input.len() - 1) without verifying that the input is nonempty. When an empty slice is passed, the subtraction underflows and the API precondition for slice::from_raw_parts is violated, resulting in undefined behavior (CWE-475).
