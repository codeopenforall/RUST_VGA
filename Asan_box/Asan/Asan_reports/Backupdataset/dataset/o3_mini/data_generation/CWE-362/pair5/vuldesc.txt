This code demonstrates a race condition vulnerability. It uses a global mutable static variable "SHARED" that is accessed within an unsafe block by multiple threads without any synchronization. The code performs a read-modify-write sequence without locks or atomicity, and a deliberate delay is inserted between reading and writing. This creates a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where multiple threads can operate concurrently on stale values, leading to incorrect final results.
