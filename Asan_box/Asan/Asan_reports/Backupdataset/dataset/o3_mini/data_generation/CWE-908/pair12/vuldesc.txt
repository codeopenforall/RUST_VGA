The vulnerability stems from the use of uninitialized memory. In the constructor for the structure (Item), the 'public' field is only conditionally initialized. When 'flag' is false, this field is never assigned a value, yet it is later read in the sum() function. This use of an uninitialized resource violates safe initialization protocols (CWE-908) and may lead to undefined behavior, especially when accessed concurrently.
