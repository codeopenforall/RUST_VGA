In the corrected version, the configuration instance is fully initialized. The 'create_instance' function now explicitly sets both the 'value' and 'active' fields – with 'active' assigned to true – ensuring that no undefined behavior occurs. As a result, the subsequent use of 'is_active' and 'compute' in a concurrent context yields predictable, correct results. This fix addresses the uninitialized resource vulnerability by ensuring all fields of the structure are properly set before use.
