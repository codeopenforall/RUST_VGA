This vulnerable code makes use of unsafe Rust constructs to create a configuration structure. 
The function that "loads" the configuration uses MaybeUninit and initializes only the 'timeout' field, 
leaving 'retries' uninitialized. The uninitialized 'retries' field is then accessed via a concurrently shared pointer,
resulting in a use of an uninitialized resource (CWE-908). Such misuse can lead to unpredictable behavior.
