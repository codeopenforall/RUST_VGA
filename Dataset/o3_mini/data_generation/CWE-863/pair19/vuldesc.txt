This vulnerable code accepts an arbitrary count from user input and uses it to drive a loop within an unsafe block.
The code allocates a fixed-size buffer of 50 elements but does not verify that the supplied count does not exceed this limit.
This absence of bounds checking leads to potential out‐of‐bounds memory writes (a form of resource exhaustion and memory corruption),
which may allow an attacker to compromise program integrity.
