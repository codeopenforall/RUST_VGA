This version accepts an arbitrary number of tasks without enforcing any limit. 
Inside the heavy_work method, a new thread is spawned for every task, and an unsafe memory allocation 
is performed in each thread based on the task index. No checks are applied to the incoming task count; 
if the input is too high, it can lead to resource exhaustion (excessive thread creation and memory allocations), 
potentially triggering a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
