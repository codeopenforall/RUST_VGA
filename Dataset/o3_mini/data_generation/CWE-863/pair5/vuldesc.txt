This vulnerable code allows an attacker to force the system into creating an extremely high number of threads by providing a large input count, leading to resource exhaustion (CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization via resource abuse). In addition, the unsafe block performs unchecked raw pointer operations on a vector that may be empty, risking memory corruption. There are no limits enforced on either thread creation or memory allocation.
