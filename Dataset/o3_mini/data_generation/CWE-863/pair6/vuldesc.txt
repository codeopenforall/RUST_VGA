This version is vulnerable because it does not impose any limits on resource allocation.
It allows unbounded memory allocation and unthrottled thread spawning, which could be
exploited to exhaust system resources. The unsafe block performs memory allocation and
pointer arithmetic without validating if the requested size (derived from the unbounded input)
is reasonable. This can lead to either excessive memory consumption or crashes in real-world scenarios.
