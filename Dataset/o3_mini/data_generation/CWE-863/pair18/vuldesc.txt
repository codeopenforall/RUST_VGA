The vulnerability exists in the authorization check inside the execute method. It uses an unsafe block to compare only the first four bytes of the provided token with the expected "admin" string. This flawed comparison allows tokens like "admiXYZ" to be erroneously accepted, granting unauthorized access. Once unauthorized access is granted, the code spawns an unbounded number of threads that allocate resources without any throttling or limits.
