This code suffers from an allocation of resources without limits: the user can specify an arbitrarily large number (n) to spawn that many threads.
There is no throttling or cap, and the use of an unsafe block combined with unbounded thread spawning mimics real-world unsafe patterns
that may lead to resource exhaustion (CWE-863).
