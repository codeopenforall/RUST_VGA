The program accepts an allocation size from user input and spawns a thread that unsafely allocates a vector with capacity equal to the requested size. The unsafe block uses Vec::set_len without initializing the memory properly for its entire length. No checks are imposed to limit the requested allocation size, meaning an attacker can request an excessive allocation leading to resource exhaustion (CWE-863). This simulates a real-world vulnerability in resource management.
