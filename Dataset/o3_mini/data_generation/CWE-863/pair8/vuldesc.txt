The above code creates an actor and a controller that executes tasks. The vulnerability arises in the function that runs tasks: it fails to enforce any restrictions on the number of tasks a non-privileged actor can request. This missing authorization check allows an attacker to trigger unbounded resource allocation, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or denial of service. An unsafe block is used when updating a global counter, mimicking real-world unsafe operations.
