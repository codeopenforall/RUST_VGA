This code demonstrates a vulnerability where a configuration file is created with default file permissions set to 0o777.
Such permissions allow any user on the system to read, write, or execute the file, leading to potential privilege escalation 
or unauthorized modification. The use of an unsafe block and concurrent thread spawns mimics real-world patterns seen in RustSec reports.
CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is triggered by the overly permissive file creation mode.
