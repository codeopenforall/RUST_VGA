This code creates a log file with overly permissive permissions (0o777), using an unsafe block along with OpenOptionsExt to set the file mode. The use of insecure permissions exposes the file to unauthorized read, write, or execute access by any user. Additionally, the code simulates real-world conditions by leveraging concurrency with threads and shared mutable state without proper encapsulation of OS-level security concerns.
