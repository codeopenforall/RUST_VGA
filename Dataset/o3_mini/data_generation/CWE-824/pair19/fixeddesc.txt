In this corrected implementation the file creation process has been modified to use a secure access mode (0o600) instead of the overly permissive 0o777 mode. This limits file access strictly to the owner, preventing unintended read/write operations by other users. Additionally, the unsafe block and pointer manipulations have been removed as they were unnecessary for the intended functionality, thereby aligning the code with Rust’s safety principles.
