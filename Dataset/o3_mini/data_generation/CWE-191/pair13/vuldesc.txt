The vulnerable code defines a Container with an unsigned integer and subtracts an input amount from it within an unsafe block. Because no check is performed before subtraction, subtracting a larger number (20) from a small initial value (10) causes an integer underflow. In a release build, this underflow wraps around to a very large number (e.g., 4294967286 for u32), leading to incorrect behavior and potential security issues.
