The corrected version addresses the integer underflow vulnerability by explicitly checking that the deduction does not exceed the current value before performing subtraction. In the decrease method, an error is returned instead of subtracting when the deduction would cause underflow. Consequently, the final value remains correct even in a concurrent context. This pattern aligns with Rust community idioms to prevent unsafe arithmetic errors while ensuring logic correctness.
