This implementation uses unsafe manual memory management. The Resource struct allocates memory for an integer and an atomic flag via Box::into_raw. Its Clone implementation creates only a shallow copy (duplicating pointers). Consequently, when both the original and its clone drop, each invokes the Drop implementation. The first drop successfully frees the memory, while the second detects that the flag is already set and panics. This scenario mimics a double free vulnerability (CWE-415).
