The corrected code fixes the double free vulnerability by nullifying the raw pointer after its
memory is freed in the manual deallocation method. Consequently, the Drop implementation first checks
if the pointer is null before attempting to free the memory. This guarantees that the deallocation
happens only once, eliminating the double free issue.
