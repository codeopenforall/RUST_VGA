The above vulnerable code exposes a sensitive resource without adequate authorization checks. The function “obtain_data” uses an unsafe block to read the secret data without verifying whether the provided credential holds sufficient privileges. Consequently, even callers with non-admin credentials (e.g., "user") obtain the secret. This pattern mimics real-world flaws where unsafe blocks and concurrent access can bypass intended access controls, reminiscent of reported issues in RustSec.
