The vulnerability arises from an improper authorization control: the update method fails to verify that the requesting user has administrative privileges before modifying the sensitive resource.
This unsafe operation (via pointer casting within an unsafe block) enables unauthorized modifications by any user, thereby exposing CWE-285.
