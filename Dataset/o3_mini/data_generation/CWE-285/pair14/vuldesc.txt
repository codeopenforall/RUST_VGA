This code implements a controller for a resource containing a secret value protected by an owner identity.
However, the modify() function fails to verify that the provided caller (e.g., "intruder") matches the resource owner.
It uses an unsafe block to update the secret via a raw pointer and drops the mutex guard early,
resulting in an authorization bypass where any caller can update the secret.
