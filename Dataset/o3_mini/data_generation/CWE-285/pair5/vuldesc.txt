The code above is vulnerable to improper authorization because it fails to enforce admin-only access when retrieving a sensitive secret. The execute function does not verify the caller’s privileges before allowing access. Furthermore, the unsafe block is used to perform a raw pointer dereference without additional runtime checks, mimicking complex real-world misuse as seen in reported issues.
