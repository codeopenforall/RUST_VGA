This version contains a calculation bug due to incorrect operator precedence in the arithmetic expression.
Instead of computing (price * (100 - discount)) / 100, it computes (price * 100) - (discount / 100),
resulting in a drastically incorrect total. The unsafe block is used to dereference the discount value,
mimicking lower-level unsafe practices common in real-world systems.
