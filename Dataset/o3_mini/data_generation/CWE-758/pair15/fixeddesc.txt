In this corrected version, the arithmetic order has been fixed to multiply each sensor reading by the conversion factor before dividing by the divisor. This change—from reading * (factor/2) to (reading * factor)/2—ensures that the multiplication occurs with full precision prior to division, thereby avoiding the integer rounding error present in the vulnerable version. The rewritten code keeps the unsafe block and concurrency patterns intact to closely emulate real-world scenarios while resolving the calculation error.
