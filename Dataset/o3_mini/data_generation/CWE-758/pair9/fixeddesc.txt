In this corrected version, the compute method has been fixed by reordering the arithmetic operations. The sum is first multiplied by the scale factor and then divided by the count, which preserves the precision that would otherwise be lost in integer division. Furthermore, the unnecessary unsafe block has been removed to rely solely on safe Rust practices, while retaining concurrency through the use of Arc and thread spawning.
