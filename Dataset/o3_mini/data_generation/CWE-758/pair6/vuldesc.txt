This code implements an average calculation by iterating over a vector using unsafe pointer arithmetic and spawning a separate thread to perform the computation. The mathematical vulnerability arises because the sum is divided by (len - 1) instead of len, leading to a miscalculation of the true average (CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation). For example, for input [1,2,3] the expected average is 2, but the computation returns 3.
