This code contains an incorrect calculation vulnerability (CWE-682). The mistake arises in the unsafe compute function where the arithmetic operations are grouped incorrectly. The operation (numerator / denominator) * scale is performed instead of the intended numerator / (denominator * scale). As a result, when given numerator=100, denominator=5, and scale=10, the function returns 200 instead of the intended 2. The issue is further obscured by the use of unsafe pointer dereferencing and concurrent execution.
