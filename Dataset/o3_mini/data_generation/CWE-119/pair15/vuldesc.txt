The above code exhibits an out‐of‐bounds memory access vulnerability (CWE-119). In the implementation of the "update" method, an unsafe block is used to write to a raw pointer obtained from the vector without any bounds checking. When an invalid index (e.g. 15) is used, the code performs unchecked pointer arithmetic and writes to memory beyond the allocated buffer. This mimics real-world unsafe Rust patterns where concurrency and unsafe pointer operations can lead to memory corruption.
