This code allocates a fixed 10-byte array and provides an update method that directly writes to a given index without verifying if it is within the valid bounds. The use of an unsafe block with unchecked pointer arithmetic allows an attacker or bug to write outside the allocated memory buffer (CWE-119). Such out-of-bound writes can corrupt adjacent memory, invoking undefined behavior and potentially leading to exploitable security vulnerabilities.
