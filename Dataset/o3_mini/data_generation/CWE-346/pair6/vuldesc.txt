This code’s header validation logic is vulnerable because it uses an unsafe block that only compares the first 12 bytes of the "Origin" header against a trusted string constant. An attacker could supply a header whose first 12 bytes match but includes malicious data afterward, causing the validation to incorrectly succeed. This mimics real-world origin validation errors where partial comparisons lead to security bypasses.
