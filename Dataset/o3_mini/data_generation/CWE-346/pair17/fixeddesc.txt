The corrected implementation removes the unsafe block and performs a simple, strict equality check 
against the known trusted origin. By comparing the received 'Origin' header directly with the expected 
value, it effectively blocks malicious requests. This change mitigates the risk of CSRF/SSRF pivot attacks 
by preventing unauthorized headers from passing the validation.
