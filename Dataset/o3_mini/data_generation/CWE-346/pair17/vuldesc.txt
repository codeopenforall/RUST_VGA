This vulnerable implementation employs an unsafe block to perform raw pointer manipulation on the 
'Origin' header value. The check erroneously approves any non-empty header value by using a logical OR 
with a strict match against the trusted origin. Consequently, requests bearing malicious origins are 
improperly authorized, creating a risk for CSRF/SSRF pivot attacks (CWE-346).
