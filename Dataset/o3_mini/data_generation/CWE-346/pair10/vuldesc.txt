The vulnerability arises from an unsafe conversion of the "Origin" header using CStr::from_ptr without proper validation. The system blindly trusts the header content and, due to flawed logic, allows any request—even if the origin does not match the secure, allowed domain. This behavior mimics real-world issues where reverse proxies or lax CORS policies lead to CSRF or SSRF pivots, as reported in various RustSec advisories.
