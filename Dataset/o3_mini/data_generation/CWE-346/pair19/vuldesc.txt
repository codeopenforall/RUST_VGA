This vulnerable code incorrectly performs an origin header check by comparing the raw pointers of the strings rather than their actual content.
The unsafe block assumes that the header value provided will have the same pointer as the trusted literal.
In practice, even if the header content is correct, the memory locations will differ, causing authorized requests to be rejected.
This design flaw may be exploited when relying on user-supplied header information, exposing CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error) risks.
