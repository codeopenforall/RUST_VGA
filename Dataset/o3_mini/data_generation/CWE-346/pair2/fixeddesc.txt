The corrected code eliminates the unsafe partial memory check and instead performs a full, safe string equality comparison against the expected trusted origin ("https://trusted.com"). By avoiding raw pointer manipulation and unsafe blocks, this implementation ensures that only an exact match is accepted, thereby mitigating the origin validation error and preventing malicious inputs like "https://evil.com" from being mistakenly trusted.
