The corrected version eliminates unsafe memory aliasing by using Arc to share ownership of the data.
Rather than obtaining a raw pointer and dropping the allocation prematurely, the code creates an Arc<Data>
that guarantees the data remains valid for every access. Once the Arc is cloned and used across threads or
functions, the data is only freed when the last reference is dropped, thus preventing use‐after‐free (CWE-416).
