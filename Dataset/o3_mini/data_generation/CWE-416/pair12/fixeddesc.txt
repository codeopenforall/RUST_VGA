In the corrected version the unsafe conversion to a raw pointer is removed. Instead, the code relies on Rust’s safe abstractions by performing computations directly on the Box-managed resource. This eliminates the possibility of using memory after it is freed since the memory is released only when the Box goes out of scope. The spawned thread similarly uses a safely constructed Box, avoiding any aliasing or dangling pointer issues.
