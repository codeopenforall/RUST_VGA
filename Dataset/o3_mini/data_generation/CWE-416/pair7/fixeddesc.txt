The corrected version replaces the raw pointer and unsafe manual memory management with an Arc<Mutex<i32>> to achieve shared ownership and synchronization. This design eliminates the possibility of accessing memory after it has been freed. Instead of manually freeing the resource, the memory is automatically deallocated once all references are dropped. The use of locks ensures that concurrent accesses yield consistent and safe results.
