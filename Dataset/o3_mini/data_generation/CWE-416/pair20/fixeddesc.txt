The corrected code eliminates the use of raw pointers by using Arc to manage shared ownership of the Object.
A Handler now holds an Arc reference rather than a raw pointer.
This change prevents premature deallocation because the Object remains alive as long as any Arc reference exists.
Thus, the fetch() method accesses valid memory, eliminating the Use-After-Free vulnerability.
Concurrent usage remains safe and predictable.
