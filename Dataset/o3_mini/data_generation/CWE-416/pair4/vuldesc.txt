This code demonstrates a classic use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416). The program allocates a heap object,
obtains a raw pointer to it, and then frees the object by reconstructing a Box. However, the raw pointer is
still held and later dereferenced in an unsafe block in the trait implementation. Additionally, a dummy
allocation is made in an attempt to reuse the freed memory, increasing the likelihood that the pointer becomes
dangling and points to corrupted memory. This matches the real-world patterns observed in unsafe Rust code and FFI issues.
