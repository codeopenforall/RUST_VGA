The above vulnerable code uses a FileManager structure that joins user-supplied filenames with a designated root directory without performing any canonicalization or prefix checks. This allows attackers to provide filenames like "../Cargo.toml" to bypass directory restrictions and read arbitrary files. The unsafe block is used when converting raw file bytes to a UTF-8 string without validation, mimicking unsafe practices in real-world code.
