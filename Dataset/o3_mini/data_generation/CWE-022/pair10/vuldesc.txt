This vulnerable implementation suffers from CWE-022 (Path Traversal) because it directly appends the user-supplied path to the safe directory without canonicalizing the final path. As a result, an attacker can supply strings like "../" to traverse directories and access sensitive files. The use of unsafe blocks and concurrent threads further emulates a realistic environment found in many systems.
