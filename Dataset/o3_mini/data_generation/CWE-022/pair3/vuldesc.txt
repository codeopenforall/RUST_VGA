This implementation exhibits a path traversal vulnerability by naively appending the user-provided string to a fixed base directory without performing proper validations or canonicalization. The unsafe block simulates complex low-level pointer manipulation that one might find in real-world code. An attacker can supply inputs such as "../etc/passwd" to traverse directories and access unintended files.
