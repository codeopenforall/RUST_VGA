This code snippet implements a simple file management routine that naively joins a user‐supplied path with a trusted base directory using PathBuf::join. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the code does not perform any canonicalization or verification to ensure the resulting path remains within the safe directory, thereby enabling a path traversal attack (CWE-022). In addition, an unsafe block is used to convert the joined path to a CString and back, illustrating potential misuse of unsafe Rust code in real-world applications.
