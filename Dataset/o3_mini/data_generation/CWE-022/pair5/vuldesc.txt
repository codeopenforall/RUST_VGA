This vulnerable code instantiates a loader with a hardcoded base directory ("./data") and then joins it with a user-supplied filename. The flaw is that it naively uses PathBuf::join without canonicalizing or verifying that the final path is within the intended directory. As a result, an attacker can supply paths containing "../" or even absolute paths to access unauthorized files outside of the designated directory. Unsafe block usage in the conversion from bytes to a string further adds risk.
