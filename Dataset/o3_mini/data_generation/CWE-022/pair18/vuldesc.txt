The above vulnerable code accepts a user-supplied file path and naively concatenates it with a fixed base directory 
using PathBuf::join without canonicalizing or validating the resulting path. This allows an attacker to supply inputs 
like "../secret.txt" to read files outside of the intended directory. The code also uses an unsafe block for pointer 
arithmetic, mirroring patterns found in real-world RustSec issues.
