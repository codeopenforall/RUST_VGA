This code is vulnerable to CWE-022 (Path Traversal) because it constructs file paths by simply joining a base directory ("safe_dir") with a user-supplied filename. Malicious input such as "../sensitive.txt" can escape the intended directory. The lack of canonicalization or validation of the resulting path, combined with unnecessary unsafe pointer manipulation and concurrency, reflects realistic issues found in actual RustSec advisories.
