This code demonstrates a use of an uninitialized resource. The unsafe constructor initializes only the "title" field of a configuration structure and omits initializing the "amount" field. Later, this uninitialized "amount" field is read concurrently in a spawned thread. This pattern mimics the real-world issue of using a resource before it is fully set up, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or exploitation.
