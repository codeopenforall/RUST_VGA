This code demonstrates an unsafe use of uninitialized memory. The structure Settings is meant to hold configuration data; however, its unsafe constructor uses MaybeUninit to allocate memory and only initializes the addr and port fields while leaving the max_conn field uninitialized. When calc() is later invoked, it accesses max_conn, causing undefined behavior. The design mimics real‐world scenarios where improper initialization can lead to memory safety issues.
