The corrected code replaces the unsafe unchecked wrapping addition with a checked arithmetic operation.
The update method now returns a Result. If an overflow is imminent (i.e. adding 10 to 250 would exceed the maximum value for an 8‐bit integer),
the function returns an error and does not alter the internal state. This prevents any wrap-around behavior, thereby fixing
the CWE-190 integer overflow vulnerability while preserving concurrency and realistic API usage.
