This implementation computes the sum of numbers across multiple threads using unsafe raw pointer arithmetic and wrapping operations. The multiplication by the factor is performed within an unsafe block without checking for arithmetic overflow. With input values that force the u32 accumulator to wrap (e.g. u32::MAX combined with 1), the final result is corrupted due to the overflow, demonstrating CWE-190.
