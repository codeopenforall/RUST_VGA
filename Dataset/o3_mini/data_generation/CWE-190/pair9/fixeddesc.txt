In the corrected variant, the unsafe unchecked addition is replaced by a checked_add call on u32.
If the addition would overflow, checked_add returns None, and the function returns an error ("Overflow occurred").
This approach prevents erroneous wraparound and ensures that callers can detect when arithmetic exceeds type limits.
The concurrency design is preserved, but any overflow in a thread is now gracefully reported.
