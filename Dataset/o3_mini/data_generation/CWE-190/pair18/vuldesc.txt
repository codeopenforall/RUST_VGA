This code computes the factorial concurrently using shared mutable state through UnsafeCell.
It performs unchecked multiplication which, when processing large inputs (e.g. 13), can exceed u32 maximum capacity and wrap around,
resulting in an incorrect (truncated) value. This unsafe arithmetic operation is the core of the CWE-190 vulnerability.
