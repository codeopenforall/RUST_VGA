The corrected code replaces the unsafe unchecked multiplication with the safe checked multiplication using the built-in checked_mul function. This eliminates the vulnerability by returning None if an overflow occurs rather than silently wrapping the value. The structure and threading logic remain similar, preserving realistic concurrency patterns while addressing the CWE-190 vulnerability.
