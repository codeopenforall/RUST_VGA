The vulnerability arises from the use of unchecked wrapping multiplication within an unsafe block. When a large input (e.g. 5,000,000) is provided, the multiplication by 1,000 exceeds the maximum value of a 32‐bit integer, causing a silent wraparound instead of a panic or error. As a result, subsequent computations (such as the sum calculation) operate on an incorrect, overflowed value, leading to logic errors.
