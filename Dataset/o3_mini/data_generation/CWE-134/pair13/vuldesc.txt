This vulnerable implementation accepts user-controlled input and uses it directly as the format string in a call to the C function printf within an unsafe block. By not sanitizing or separating the format string from its arguments, an attacker can supply format specifiers that may read or write unintended memory. The use of concurrency and shared ownership further mimics a real-world scenario with multiple threads that each invoke the unsafe block.
