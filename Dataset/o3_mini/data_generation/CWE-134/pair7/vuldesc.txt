This vulnerable code directly uses an externally-controlled format string, received via a command-line argument, in a call to Rust’s format! macro within an unsafe block. By doing so, if a malicious user supplies a format string with additional or unexpected placeholders (for example: "Exploit: {} {}"), the program may panic or behave unexpectedly. The design incorporates realistic concurrency and shared state management to emulate a real-world scenario where such an input might be used unsafely, thus leading to CWE-134 issues.
