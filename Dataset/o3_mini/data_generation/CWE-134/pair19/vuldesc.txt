This version demonstrates a format string vulnerability. The function that processes the input converts the user-provided string to a C-style string and then passes it directly as the format string argument in an unsafe libc::printf call. Since the format string is controlled externally, malicious users can supply format specifiers (like %x) leading to unpredictable output or memory disclosure. The code also uses concurrency via threads and smart pointers (Arc/Mutex) to mimic realistic multi-threaded scenarios as seen in real-world RustSec vulnerabilities.
