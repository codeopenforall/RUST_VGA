The vulnerable code uses an unsafe FFI call to the C function snprintf, passing a user-supplied string as the format
specifier. This pattern represents CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String, where an attacker could craft a
format string that improperly reads from the stack or memory, potentially leading to information disclosure. Additionally,
the use of unsafe blocks and concurrency further complicates the control flow, closely emulating real-world scenarios
reported in RustSec advisories.
