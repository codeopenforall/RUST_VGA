In the corrected code, the Processor's process() method no longer uses the externally supplied format string.
Instead, a constant and safe format string ("%s") is used, ensuring that no extra format specifiers can be injected.
The change prevents the vulnerability by not treating user input as the formatting directive. The rest of the code
(remains the same, including concurrency and shared mutable state) to mimic the same real-world usage pattern.
