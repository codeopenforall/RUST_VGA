The corrected version addresses the vulnerability by decoupling the format string from user input. Instead of passing user-supplied data directly to printf as the format string, it uses a fixed format ("%s") that safely prints the provided string argument. This eliminates the uncontrolled format string issue and defends against potential exploits such as those using "%n" or other dangerous specifiers.
