The above code accepts a user-supplied format string and directly uses it to substitute
a secret string whenever it encounters the placeholder "{}". The unsafe block casts the
input without validation, effectively treating external input as format specifiers. If an attacker
supplies a crafted format string, they may manipulate the output to leak or misrepresent sensitive data.
This pattern mimics CWE-134, where externally-controlled format strings can lead to unintended behavior.
