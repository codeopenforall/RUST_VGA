This code is vulnerable to CWE-134: Externally-Controlled Format String. It uses an unsafe block to pass a user-supplied string directly as the format string to the C library function printf via FFI. An adversary can supply format specifiers (for example, "test %s") that may lead to memory disclosure or other undefined behavior. The use of threading and FFI mimics real-world usage patterns, while not performing any checks or sanitization on the input.
