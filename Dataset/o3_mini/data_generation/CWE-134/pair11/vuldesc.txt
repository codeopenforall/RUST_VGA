This code demonstrates CWE-134 by accepting a user-supplied format string and using it directly in a format! macro 
inside an unsafe block. The unsafe block reinterprets the internal String as a &str without proper checks and then 
uses it as the format string. If the input contains mismatched placeholders (for example, extra format specifiers), 
this may lead to panics or unintended behavior. Additional unsafe constructs and concurrency usage mimic real-world 
RustSec patterns.
