In the corrected code the vulnerability is mitigated by not passing user input directly as a format string.
Instead, the safe routine uses Rust’s formatting facilities by embedding the user input into a fixed format
("{}"). This ensures that any percent (%) characters in the input are treated as literal characters rather than
format specifiers, neutralizing the externally-controlled format string vulnerability (CWE-134).
