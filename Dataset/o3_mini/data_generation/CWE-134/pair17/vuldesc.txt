The vulnerable code uses a foreign function interface (FFI) to call the C library function snprintf,
passing a user-supplied string directly as the format string. This externally-controlled format string
can lead to unexpected behavior (reading from the stack or other memory) if the input contains
format specifiers (e.g., "%x", "%s"). This mimics real-world vulnerabilities (CWE-134) when user-controlled
data is used directly in formatting functions without sanitization.
