This version suffers from CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). It creates a configuration object containing a sensitive secret ("supersecret") and, using an unsafe block, directly copies raw bytes from memory without any validation or encryption. The sensitive data is then transmitted in clear text via a concurrent thread. The use of unsafe code coupled with improper handling of sensitive data mimics real-world issues reported in RustSec advisories.
