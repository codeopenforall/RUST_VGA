This implementation suffers from CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data). The secret is read from an environment variable and then processed by copying it via an unsafe memory operation. The method that is expected to safeguard the sensitive information simply returns it in clear text without any encryption, making it vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during storage or transmission.
