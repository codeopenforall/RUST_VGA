The revised code now applies a simple XOR cipher to the configuration data before sending it over the network. By doing so, the sensitive data is no longer transmitted in cleartext, mitigating the CWE-311 vulnerability. In addition, the unsafe block has been removed in favor of safe byte handling, thereby aligning with secure Rust practices.
