This code simulates a real-world vulnerability where sensitive data is handled carelessly. The sensitive secret ("SuperSecretPassword123!") is stored in plain text on disk in "secret.txt" without any encryption. Additionally, an unsafe block is used to manipulate memory directly, which may lead to inadvertent leakage of the secret when processed concurrently. This pattern mimics reported issues (CWE-311) where secrets are transmitted or stored without protection.
