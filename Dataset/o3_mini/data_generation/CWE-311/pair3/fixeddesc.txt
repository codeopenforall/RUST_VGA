This fixed implementation addresses CWE-311 by encrypting the sensitive data prior to transmission. Instead of using unsafe memory operations,
the code safely accesses the configuration data and applies a simple XOR-based encryption in the secure_transform function.
Although the XOR cipher is for demonstration only, it clearly illustrates the necessity to protect sensitive data in transit.
In production scenarios, a secure encryption algorithm like AES or full TLS should be applied.
