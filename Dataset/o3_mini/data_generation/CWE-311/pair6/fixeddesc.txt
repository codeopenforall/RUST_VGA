The corrected implementation addresses the vulnerability by encrypting the sensitive secret before transmission. A basic XOR cipher (used here purely for demonstration purposes) is applied to the data immediately after its unsafe memory access, ensuring that the secret is not exposed in plaintext over the network. The encryption-decryption process confirms that the original secret can be recovered by authorized components while making the transmitted data secure.
