This code loads a sensitive secret from a configuration file in cleartext and transmits it unencrypted over an insecure TCP connection.
An unsafe block is used to convert the string slice to raw bytes for transmission.
The concurrent architecture using threads and Arc mimics a realistic scenario where improper handling of sensitive data leads to a CWE-311 vulnerability.
