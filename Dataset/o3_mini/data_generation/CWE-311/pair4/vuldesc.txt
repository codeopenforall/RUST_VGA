This code constructs a configuration structure containing an API key stored in plaintext. The transmit() method unsafely converts the string into a byte slice and returns it directly, resulting in cleartext sensitive data being handled and transmitted. The use of unsafe block and concurrent threads further mimics real-world misuse where cleartext secrets are inadvertently exposed.
