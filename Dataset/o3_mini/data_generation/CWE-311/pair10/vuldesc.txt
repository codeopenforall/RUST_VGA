This code constructs a configuration object containing a sensitive secret and then transmits the secret in plaintext. The transmission uses an unsafe block to directly access the underlying memory of the string without encryption, which directly violates the requirement to encrypt sensitive data before storage or transmission (CWE-311). Additionally, the use of concurrent threads accessing the configuration mimics real-world scenarios where such exposures may occur.
