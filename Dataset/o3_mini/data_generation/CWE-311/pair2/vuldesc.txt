This code processes a sensitive secret without any encryption. It uses an unsafe block to dereference a raw pointer to access the secret, and then the data is transmitted via an inter-thread channel in cleartext. Such handling of secret material directly, without encryption, exemplifies CWE-311 (Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data) because sensitive information (i.e. "SuperSecretPassword") is exposed without protection.
