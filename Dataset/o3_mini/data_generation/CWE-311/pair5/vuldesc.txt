This insecure code transmits sensitive configuration data ("supersecret") in plaintext over a simulated network channel.
It utilizes unsafe blocks and concurrency primitives in a realistic pattern but fails to protect the secret by not encrypting it.
Such exposure of sensitive data constitutes a CWE-311 vulnerability.
