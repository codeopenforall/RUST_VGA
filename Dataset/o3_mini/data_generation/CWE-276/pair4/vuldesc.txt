This insecure implementation creates a file with overly permissive permissions (0o777), which can expose the file to unauthorized read/write by any user. The code further includes an unsafe block that performs pointer arithmetic without proper checks, mimicking a common risky pattern in systems programming. Additionally, the concurrent file write pattern uses shared smart pointers (Arc and Mutex) correctly but is undermined by the misconfiguration of file permissions.
