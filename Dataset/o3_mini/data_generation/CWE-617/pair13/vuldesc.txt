The code above leverages unsafe pointer arithmetic and spawns a concurrent thread that can modify shared state (via Arc and Mutex). If the input (attacker-supplied index) is even and within bounds, the spawned thread sets the corresponding element to 100. Later, an unsafe block accesses the element using pointer offset and asserts that its value is below 50. An attacker can supply an even index to force the thread to change the value and hence trigger the assertion, leading to a reachable assertion failure (DoS).
