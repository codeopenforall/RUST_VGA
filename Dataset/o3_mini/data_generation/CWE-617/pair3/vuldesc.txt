The code employs an unsafe block to update a shared mutable state and then directly asserts that the value is below 100 via an assert!(). Since the input is attacker-controlled (via command-line argument) and this check is performed unconditionally inside a concurrent thread, an input of 100 or greater causes the assertion to fail. This reachable assertion on external input can be exploited to trigger a panic, leading to a denial-of-service.
