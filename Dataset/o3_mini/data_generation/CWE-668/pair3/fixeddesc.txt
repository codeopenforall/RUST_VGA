In this corrected version the vulnerability is mitigated by adding an explicit check for a zero divisor before performing the division operation. Although an unsafe block is still used to mirror realistic low-level patterns, the code now verifies that the divisor is not zero; if it is, the function returns None. This prevents the division by zero panic and ensures that all threads operate in a controlled manner, even when encountering erroneous inputs.
