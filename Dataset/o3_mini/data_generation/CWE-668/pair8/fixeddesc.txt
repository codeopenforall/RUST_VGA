The corrected version includes an explicit check for a zero divisor before entering 
the unsafe block. If the input is zero, the function safely returns None instead of 
attempting the division. This change preserves the overall structure (including concurrency 
and unsafe code) while eliminating the division-by-zero vulnerability.
