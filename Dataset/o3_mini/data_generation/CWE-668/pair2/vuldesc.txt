This version demonstrates a classic divide-by-zero vulnerability. The function that performs arithmetic does so inside an unsafe block by dereferencing a raw pointer to retrieve an integer and then dividing it by a denominator that is not validated. In this example, the denominator is explicitly set to zero. Running this code will cause a panic at runtime due to unchecked division by zero, mimicking real vulnerabilities reported under CWE-369.
