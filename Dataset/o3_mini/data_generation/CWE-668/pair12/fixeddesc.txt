In this corrected version the compute method has been reworked to check whether the divisor is zero before proceeding. If the divisor is zero, it returns an error ("Division by zero error") rather than performing the unsafe division. The rest of the code—including the use of concurrency (Arc and thread spawning) and the public safe_compute wrapper—is retained to simulate a realistic application pattern.
