The above code defines a struct Engine with a method compute that performs division within an unsafe block without verifying that the divisor is nonzero. In a concurrent context (using Arc and thread::spawn), the function is invoked with a zero divisor, triggering a division by zero. This is a realistic example of CWE-369, where unchecked arithmetic operations lead to runtime panics.
