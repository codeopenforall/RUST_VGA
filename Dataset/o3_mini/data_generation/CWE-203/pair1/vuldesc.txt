This vulnerable implementation simulates an authentication system that leaks sensitive state information through its error messages. When an authentication attempt is made, it distinguishes between "User does not exist" and "Invalid password". Such detailed feedback allows an attacker to deduce which usernames are valid. Additionally, the code uses unsafe blocks and concurrency primitives (Arc, Mutex) to mimic realistic complex patterns found in real-world systems.
