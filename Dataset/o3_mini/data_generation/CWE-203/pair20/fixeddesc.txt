In the revised implementation, the verify method has been refactored to ensure that no sensitive state is leaked through error messages. Instead of differentiating between a non-existent username and an incorrect password, the function returns a generic "Authentication failed" error for any failure. Additionally, the unsafe block and raw pointer manipulation have been removed in favor of safe iteration over the accounts vector.
