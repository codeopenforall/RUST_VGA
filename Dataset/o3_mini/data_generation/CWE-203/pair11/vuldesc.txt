The code above demonstrates an authentication mechanism that uses unsafe blocks and concurrent threads.
It leaks sensitive state by returning distinct error messages ("User does not exist" vs "Incorrect password")
depending on whether the username is found in the internal HashMap.
This discrepancy allows an attacker to probe for valid usernames, thereby exposing sensitive information (CWE-203).
