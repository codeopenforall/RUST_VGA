The code above implements an authentication-like mechanism where a hashed collection of user credentials is stored in a thread-safe container. A vulnerability exists as it differentiates between a non-existent user ("UserMissing") and an incorrect credential ("CredentialMismatch"). This distinct messaging, triggered via dissimilar error variants, can leak sensitive state information about user existence to an attacker. Unsafe blocks and concurrency are integrated to mimic complexities found in real-world unsafe Rust applications.
