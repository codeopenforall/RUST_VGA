This code simulates an authentication service that uses an unsynchronized UnsafeCell to store user credentials.
The vulnerability occurs when the authentication check returns different error messages for different failure cases.
When a valid username is provided with an incorrect password, the error message reveals the stored (and sensitive) expected password.
This discrepancy in error messages can be exploited by an attacker to verify the existence of users and even extract valid credentials, thereby exposing sensitive state.
