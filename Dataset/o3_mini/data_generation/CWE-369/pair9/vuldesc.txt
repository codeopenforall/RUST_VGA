This code performs an unchecked division within an unsafe block without verifying that the divisor is nonzero. As a result, supplying zero as the divisor (from user input or otherwise) will trigger a panic. The vulnerability is further exacerbated by concurrent execution contexts (with threads), mimicking real-world scenarios reported in RustSec for CWE-369.
