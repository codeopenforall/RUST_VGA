The above code performs an arithmetic division using an unsafe block that reads
the divisor via a raw pointer. It does not check whether the divisor is zero,
resulting in a divide-by-zero operation that leads to a panic at runtime.
This pattern mimics real-world unsafe numeric code where unchecked arithmetic
operations can lead to security and stability issues (CWE-369).
