The corrected version introduces an explicit check to ensure that the divisor is non-zero before division is attempted.
This simple validation prevents a division-by-zero scenario and avoids the unsafe usage of unchecked division.
Additionally, the unsafe block is removed, promoting safer, idiomatic Rust code.
