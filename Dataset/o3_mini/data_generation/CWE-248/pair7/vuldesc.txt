This implementation contains a vulnerability related to CWE-248. The unsafe operation
performs raw pointer usage without proper lifecycle management and does not catch panics
from its inner thread. In particular, when the input is zero (a boundary error condition),
the unsafe block triggers a panic that is not handled, causing an abnormal termination.
Additionally, the allocated memory is leaked because the raw pointer is never freed.
