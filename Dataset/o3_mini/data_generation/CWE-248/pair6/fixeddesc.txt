The fixed code mitigates CWE-248 by catching panics that occur in the spawned thread. Instead of using join().unwrap(), the thread join result is matched and, if an error (panic) is encountered, an Err value is returned. This controlled handling avoids propagation of the panic across thread boundaries, ensuring that abnormal termination is prevented and the caller can safely handle the error.
