The code above spawns a thread that executes an unsafe block. When the provided flag is true, the unsafe block deliberately triggers a panic. The thread is joined using unwrap(), which, in the event of a panic inside the thread, unwraps an error value and causes the entire process to abort abnormally. This lack of proper panic handling across thread boundaries can lead to unexpected termination, especially problematic when interfacing with FFI or critical concurrent operations.
