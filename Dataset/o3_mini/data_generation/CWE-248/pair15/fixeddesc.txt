In this corrected version, the implementation addresses the lack of panic handling by explicitly matching on the result of thread join. Instead of unwrapping the join result (which would propagate the panic), the code returns a safe error code (-1) when a panic is detected. This change prevents panics from propagating unexpectedly and ensures reliable error management across thread boundaries.
