This code defines a Processor struct that holds a callback function pointer. Its execute method invokes the callback within an unsafe block without any panic handling. When the input equals "trigger", the callback panics, and because this panic is not caught (especially within a thread), it leads to an uncaught exception across the thread boundary, which is indicative of CWE-248.
