The vulnerable code spawns a thread that accesses a global raw pointer within an unsafe block. When a certain condition (here, value equals 10) is met, the thread panics. Because there is no unwind protection (such as catch_unwind) around the thread’s execution, the panic is propagated via join().unwrap(), triggering an abnormal termination without proper handling. This behavior exemplifies CWE-248, where a panic (akin to an exception) crosses thread boundaries unhandled.
