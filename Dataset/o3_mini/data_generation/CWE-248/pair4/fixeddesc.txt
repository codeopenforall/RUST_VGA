In the fixed version, the vulnerability is mitigated by wrapping the critical unsafe section in a call to std::panic::catch_unwind within the spawned thread. This prevents a panic from propagating outside the thread, thus averting abnormal termination. The join on the thread no longer receives a panic error, and the process function returns Ok(()). This pattern reflects a realistic remediation for handling panics in concurrent, unsafe operations as highlighted in RustSec advisories.
