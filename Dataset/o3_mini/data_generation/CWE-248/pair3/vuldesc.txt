The vulnerable code spawns a thread executing an unsafe function that panics on receiving invalid input (a negative number). Because the main thread simply unwraps the result of thread.join(), any panic inside the thread is not caught and leads directly to program termination. This lack of panic handling on a thread boundary reflects CWE-248, where abnormal termination occurs due to an uncaught exception.
