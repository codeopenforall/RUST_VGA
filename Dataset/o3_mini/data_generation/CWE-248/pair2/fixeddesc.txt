In this corrected version the function execute wraps the thread’s operation in a panic::catch_unwind block. This ensures that if a panic occurs within the thread, it is captured as an error rather than causing an abnormal termination. The join of the thread then returns a nested Result that is properly handled. This fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that panics do not propagate uncaught, aligning with best practices when working with unsafe code and concurrency.
