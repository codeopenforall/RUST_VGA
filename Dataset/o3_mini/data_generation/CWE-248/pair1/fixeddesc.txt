The corrected version wraps the unsafe operation inside a panic::catch_unwind block within the thread. This prevents the panic triggered by a simulated null pointer dereference from escaping the thread, averting abnormal termination. As a result, run_app() completes successfully (or can handle the error internally) making the application robust against uncaught panics as described in CWE-248.
