In the corrected version, the unsafe operation is wrapped inside std::panic::catch_unwind so that
if the dangerous condition is met and a panic is triggered, the panic is captured instead of causing
an abort. Furthermore, the main thread inspects the result from join() rather than unwrapping it
directly, which prevents the program from terminating abnormally. This approach mirrors robust error
handling patterns seen in production Rust code when dealing with concurrency and unsafe blocks.
