In the fixed version, the unsafe arithmetic call is wrapped inside a std::panic::catch_unwind block which intercepts any panic (such as a division-by-zero). The perform_action function returns a Result type, allowing the caller (in this case, the thread spawned in main) to handle errors gracefully rather than allowing an abnormal termination. This mechanism prevents panics from escaping across thread boundaries.
