The code above spawns a thread that calls an unsafe function 'trigger'. When
'flag' is true, the unsafe function triggers a panic without any local
attempt to catch it. The thread’s panic is propagated when calling join()
with unwrap(), causing an unhandled exception. This pattern can lead to an
abnormal termination and is representative of CWE-248 where panics cross
thread boundaries unchecked.
