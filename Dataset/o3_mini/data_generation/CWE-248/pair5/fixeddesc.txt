In the fixed code, the unsafe function is still used, but its potential to panic is
mitigated by wrapping its call in panic::catch_unwind. This means that if a panic occurs,
it is caught, and an error is returned rather than letting the panic propagate to the thread
join handle. This design avoids an uncaught exception via the thread’s join and conforms to 
the secure practice of handling abnormal terminations gracefully.
