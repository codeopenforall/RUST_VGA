The vulnerability in this code lies in the function that interprets the result of the update function. 
Even though the update function returns an Err when an error condition occurs (i.e. a negative counter value), 
the perform function incorrectly treats any Err as a success. This flaw could allow the program to continue 
under erroneous conditions, potentially leading to undefined behavior or corrupted state in a real system.
