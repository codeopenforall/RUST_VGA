This code improperly validates user-controlled input for the expected slice length. In the functions execute and parallel_run, the unsafe block uses from_utf8_unchecked to convert a slice of the internal string based solely on a parsed length from user input, without checking that the provided length is less than or equal to the actual buffer length. This may lead to out-of-bound memory access and undefined behavior (CWE-020: Improper Input Validation).
