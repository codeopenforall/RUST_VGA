The revised code performs proper input validation before performing any unsafe operations. In both execute and parallel_run, the code now checks that the user-provided length does not exceed the length of the available data, ensuring the slice operation remains in bounds. This fix prevents out-of-bound memory access, mitigating the CWE-020 vulnerability.
