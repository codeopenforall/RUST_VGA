This version suffers from CWE-020: Improper Input Validation. The code extracts a 32-bit length from
the user-controlled input without verifying that the input buffer actually contains “claimed” bytes
beyond the header. By using unsafe constructs (from_raw_parts and from_utf8_unchecked) without bounds 
checks, it allows attackers to supply a length that exceeds the real data size, potentially leading to 
out-of-bound memory reads and undefined behavior in concurrent contexts.
