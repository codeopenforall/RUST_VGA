This code accepts user-controlled data as input to specify an index into a fixed-sized vector.
It then employs an unsafe block with pointer arithmetic to write to that index without verifying that the index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.
If an out-of-bound index (for example, "15") is provided, this can lead to undefined behavior manifested as memory corruption or a segmentation fault.
Concurrency is involved via a spawned thread that also modifies the buffer, adding further complexity typical of real-world unsafe code scenarios.
