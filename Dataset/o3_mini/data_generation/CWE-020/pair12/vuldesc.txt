This vulnerable code accepts a user-supplied string and immediately parses it as an index without checking if it is within the valid bounds of a fixed-size array. The unsafe block uses pointer arithmetic to write to the array, which can result in writing outside the array’s bounds (CWE-020: Improper Input Validation). Such unchecked access may lead to memory corruption and undefined behavior in a concurrent or multi-threaded context.
