The vulnerable implementation fails to validate user-controlled input properly. It blindly trusts that the first four characters of the input contain a valid numeric length and that the subsequent bytes exist. It then unsafely slices the input and uses from_utf8_unchecked to convert the bytes to a string. This lack of validation may result in panics (e.g. due to slicing out-of-bounds) or undefined behavior when processing improperly formatted input.
