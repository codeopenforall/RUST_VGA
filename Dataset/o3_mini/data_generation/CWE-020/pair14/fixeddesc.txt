The corrected implementation introduces proper input validation. It first checks that the input is long enough to contain the 4-character length field. After parsing the length, it validates that the input contains the expected number of subsequent characters. Finally, it safely converts the specified slice from bytes to a UTF‑8 string using from_utf8, which returns a Result to gracefully handle any errors. These validations prevent out-of-bound slicing and unsafe conversions.
