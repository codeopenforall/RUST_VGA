In the corrected code, the signature verification process is properly implemented. The validate() method now computes the expected signature by reversing the message (as dictated by the chosen algorithm) and then compares it with the provided signature. This ensures that only data with a correctly computed signature is accepted. The unsafe code block from the vulnerable version has been removed from the verification logic, ensuring a safe and proper cryptographic check.
