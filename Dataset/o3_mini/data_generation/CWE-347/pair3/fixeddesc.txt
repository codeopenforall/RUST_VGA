The fix involves removing the flawed bypass logic from the verification routine. Instead of
allowing a signature starting with 0x00 to automatically pass, the corrected routine strictly
compares the entire signature against the expected value. This eliminates the possibility of attackers
providing malformed signatures to bypass security, thereby addressing the CWE-347 vulnerability.
