This code exhibits an improper verification of a cryptographic signature. The verification function uses an unsafe block to read the algorithm string from a raw pointer and ignores its actual content. Consequently, it bypasses the check that the signature was created for the expected algorithm (e.g. "ed25519") and always returns true, accepting any payload regardless of its actual signature validity.
