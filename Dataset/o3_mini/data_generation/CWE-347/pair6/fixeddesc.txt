The revised implementation eliminates the unsafe block and instead performs a proper verification
of the signature using safe Rust constructs. The logic now checks that the provided signature matches
an expected valid signature ("VALID_SIGNATURE") and that the message meets defined criteria.
This proper validation ensures that only authentically signed data is accepted, thereby resolving CWE-347.
