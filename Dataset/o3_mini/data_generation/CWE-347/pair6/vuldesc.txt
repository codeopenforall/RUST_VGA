This code attempts to simulate cryptographic signature verification using concurrency and an unsafe block.
However, it improperly “verifies” the signature by bypassing any real validation logic – the unsafe block
always returns true, irrespective of the signature's authenticity. This mimics CWE-347, where improper verification 
allows invalid cryptographic signatures to be accepted.
