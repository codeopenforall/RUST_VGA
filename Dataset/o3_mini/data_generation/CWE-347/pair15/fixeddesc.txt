The corrected code performs a proper string equality check to ensure that the provided algorithm exactly matches the expected value ("ed25519"). Instead of relying on unsafe pointer comparisons, it uses Rust’s safe string comparison to enforce the algorithm constraint. If the supplied algorithm is not "ed25519", the verification immediately fails. This prevents attackers from bypassing the intended cryptographic checks.
