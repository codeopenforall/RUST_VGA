The corrected code addresses the vulnerability by enforcing proper checks on the domain parameter. Instead of relying on an unsafe block that neglects the integrity of the domain, the secure implementation performs explicit validation: it rejects signatures if the domain is not exactly "expected_domain" and additionally performs a dummy check on the signature’s length. This change ensures that only correctly formatted and authorized input is accepted, thereby mitigating the risk of improper cryptographic signature verification.
