Description: The corrected version securely verifies the cryptographic signature by computing an expected signature from the public key and input data using a deterministic function. This expected signature is then compared to the provided signature. Unlike the vulnerable version, this implementation does not rely on an unsafe block or simply checking the signature length. In a production environment, a proper cryptographic library would handle these operations, ensuring that only valid signatures pass verification.
