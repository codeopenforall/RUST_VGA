This corrected version addresses the vulnerability by performing a proper check. It first validates that the cryptographic context (represented by the algorithm field) is as expected. Then, rather than bypassing the verification, it computes an expected signature (simulated here as the reversed message) and compares it with the provided signature. This ensures that only messages with authentic signatures are accepted, preventing forgery.
