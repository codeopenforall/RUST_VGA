This version contains a vulnerability where the cryptographic signature verification is improperly implemented. The unsafe block reads the algorithm from a raw pointer and uses flawed logic that always returns true, regardless of the input signature or algorithm correctness. This mimic real-world issues where bypassing or misusing cryptographic checks (as noted in CWE-347) results in accepting forged messages.
