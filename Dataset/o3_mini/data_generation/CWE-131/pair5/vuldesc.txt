This vulnerable code demonstrates a classic buffer allocation miscalculation. It defines a DataHandler that duplicates its internal string data using an unsafe block. Notice that it computes the required allocation size based only on the string length (omitting space for a null terminator) and then writes the termination byte out-of-bounds. This is a realistic emulation of CWE-131 where the size computation misses required padding/termination, leading to potential memory corruption in concurrent settings.
