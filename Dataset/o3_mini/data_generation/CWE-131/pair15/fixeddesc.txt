In the corrected version the buffer size is properly calculated using input.len(), ensuring that the allocated memory
precisely fits the content of the input string. This fix prevents buffer overflow by aligning the allocated size with the
actual byte-length of the string, thereby eliminating the risk of memory corruption.
