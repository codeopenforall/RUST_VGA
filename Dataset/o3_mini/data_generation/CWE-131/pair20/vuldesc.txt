This code suffers from CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size). The issue arises in the unsafe block within the process function where the length of memory to copy is calculated using std::mem::size_of::<String>() instead of the actual number of bytes in the string (original.len()). This mistake allocates a buffer that is too small, causing only a part of the original data to be copied, which may lead to truncated output or undefined behavior. The example also uses concurrency by spawning a new thread for the operation.
