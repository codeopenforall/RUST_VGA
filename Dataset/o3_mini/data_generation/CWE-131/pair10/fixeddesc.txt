In the corrected version, the replicate method calculates the buffer size by using input.len(),
which reflects the exact number of bytes in the string. This ensures that the unsafe memory copy
operation only copies the valid portion of the input’s bytes. By matching the allocation and copy size
with the actual string length, the risk of out-of-bound reads or data corruption is eliminated.
