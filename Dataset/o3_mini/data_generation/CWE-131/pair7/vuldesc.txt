This version contains a miscalculation of the number of bytes to copy by using mem::size_of_val on the string reference.
Since mem::size_of_val(&input) returns the size of the fat pointer (typically 16 bytes on 64-bit systems) rather than the actual length of the string,
an input shorter than that size will trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to undefined behavior (CWE-131).
