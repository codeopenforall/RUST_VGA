In the corrected version, the compute_sum function has been modified to include an explicit check
that validates if the input count does not exceed the length of the vector. If the count is too high,
the function panics instead of proceeding to perform unsafe memory dereferencing. This prevents
undefined behavior by ensuring that the API's preconditions are respected.
