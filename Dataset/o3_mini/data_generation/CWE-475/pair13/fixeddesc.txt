In the corrected version, the process function properly allocates the destination buffer to exactly
match the length of the provided data slice. The unsafe copy operation now copies only data.len() bytes,
and the vector’s length is set accordingly. This change ensures that no memory beyond the allocated region
is accessed, thereby eliminating the undefined behavior and preventing a potential buffer overflow.
