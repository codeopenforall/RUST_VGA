The revised version addresses the undefined behavior by adjusting the number of bytes copied. Instead of copying the entire length from an offset that skips the first element, it calculates the proper length (size minus one) ensuring that the copy operation does not exceed the bounds of the allocated memory. This adheres to the safety preconditions of ptr::copy_nonoverlapping and eliminates the undefined behavior.
