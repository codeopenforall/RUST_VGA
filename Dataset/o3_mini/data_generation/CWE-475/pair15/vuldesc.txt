This code defines a DataProcessor that allocates a fixed 10-byte source buffer and then unsafely copies a user‐specified number of bytes from it into an allocated destination buffer. When a value like 20 (which exceeds 10) is provided, the unsafe call to std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping violates its API preconditions by reading beyond the source buffer, resulting in undefined behavior (CWE-475).
