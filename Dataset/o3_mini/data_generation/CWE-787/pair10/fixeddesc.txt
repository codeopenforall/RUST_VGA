In the corrected code the vector is safely initialized using a literal vector (vec![0u8; size]) ensuring its length matches its capacity and is properly populated. The trait implementation now enforces bounds checking: the modify method verifies the index before writing. Any attempt to write outside the valid range results in an error instead of performing an unsafe write. This approach eliminates the out-of-bound vulnerability while preserving the concurrent and modular code structure.
