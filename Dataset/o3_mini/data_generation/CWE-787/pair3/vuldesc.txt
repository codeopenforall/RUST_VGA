This code creates a Buffer with a fixed number of elements and attempts to fill it with the value 1 using an unsafe block with raw pointer arithmetic. However, it mistakenly writes to ptr.add(i + 1) rather than ptr.add(i), causing an off-by-one error that writes one element past the allocated memory when i == len - 1. This out-of-bounds write is a realistic example of CWE-787 and can lead to memory corruption.
