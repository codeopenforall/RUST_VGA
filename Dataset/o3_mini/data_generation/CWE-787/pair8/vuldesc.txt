This implementation contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. In the update method, an unsafe block obtains
a mutable pointer to the vector’s internal buffer and writes to the location calculated by adding the supplied
index without checking bounds. The subsequent call to set_len blindly adjusts the length, which may exceed the
allocated capacity. This misuse can lead to memory corruption (CWE-787), especially when executed in concurrent
contexts.
