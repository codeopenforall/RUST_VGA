In the corrected code, rather than accepting an attacker-controlled path value, a constant safe path ("/usr/bin") is used for setting the environment variable "PATH" when spawning the command. This change prevents an attacker from influencing executable lookups, effectively mitigating the CWE-427 vulnerability while maintaining the same code structure, concurrency model, and use of unsafe blocks.
