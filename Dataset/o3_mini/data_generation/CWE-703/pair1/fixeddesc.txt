In this secure version, the search path is hard-coded to a trusted value ("/usr/bin") within the configuration structure. By bypassing the untrusted environment variable input, this version prevents an attacker from influencing the search path for executable resolution. Additionally, the unsafe block has been completely removed, ensuring that all pointer manipulations are handled safely. The overall structure mirrors the original implementation but eliminates the vulnerability by not relying on external input.
