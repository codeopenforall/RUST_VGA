This code erroneously handles exceptional conditions. When a timeout occurs while attempting to receive data from the spawned thread, the error is misinterpreted—returning a successful result with a default value (0) instead of returning an error. The use of an unsafe block to dereference a raw pointer further emulates real-world risky patterns seen in some RustSec advisories.
