In the corrected version, the exceptional condition is properly handled. The get() method now propagates any error—including Timeout—by returning Err(e.clone()) rather than erroneously converting a Timeout error into a successful result. This ensures that any caller of run_service() receives the correct error indication and can handle it accordingly.
