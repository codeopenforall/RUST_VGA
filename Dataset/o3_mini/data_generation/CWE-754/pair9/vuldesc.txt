This code suffers from an improper check for exceptional conditions. In the concurrent task runner,
when the cancellation flag is active (true), the code mistakenly returns a successful result (Ok)
instead of the expected cancellation error (Err(MyError::Cancelled)). This flawed check may allow
downstream components to treat a cancelled operation as successful, leading to logic errors.
