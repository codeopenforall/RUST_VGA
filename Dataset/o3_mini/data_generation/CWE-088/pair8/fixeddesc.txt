This corrected version mitigates the OS command injection vulnerability by eliminating the intermediate shell invocation. Instead of passing the untrusted input into a shell command via "sh -c" (and unsafe pointer manipulation), it directly calls the "echo" command using a safe argument. This approach prevents shell meta-character interpretation, thereby stopping any potential injection attacks.
