The above code demonstrates a command injection vulnerability (CWE-088) by accepting untrusted input and using it directly to build a shell command. The unsafe block converts the untrusted string into a C string and then to a Rust string without proper sanitization. Because the constructed command uses "sh -c" with formatted input (line 17 through line 25), any shell metacharacters present in the input (as in line 46) can lead to arbitrary command execution.
