This vulnerable code demonstrates an OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-088). In the run() function, an unsafe block is used to recreate the input string from its raw pointer without performing any validation or sanitization on its contents. The unsanitized input is then directly concatenated into a shell command that is executed via "sh -c", allowing an attacker to inject malicious shell commands (e.g. by passing metacharacters such as ';', '&', or '|').
