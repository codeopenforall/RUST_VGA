This vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to manipulate the untrusted string input by converting it to a raw pointer and back. It then uses the unsanitized input to construct a shell command that is executed using "sh -c". By concatenating the untrusted input directly into the shell command line, it introduces an OS command injection vulnerability (CWE-088) if the input contains shell metacharacters.
