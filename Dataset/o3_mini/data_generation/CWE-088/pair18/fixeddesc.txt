In the corrected code the vulnerability is mitigated by eliminating the shell invocation.
Instead of constructing a command string that is processed by a shell, the code now directly executes the "echo" binary
with the untrusted input passed as a separate argument. This prevents any shell metacharacter expansion and defends against CWE-088.
