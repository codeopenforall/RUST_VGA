In the above vulnerable code, an unsafe function performs a low‐level computation that should return an error
when given a negative integer. However, the error is silently swallowed by using unwrap_or_default(),
resulting in a default value (0) for erroneous inputs. This practice of swallowing errors without proper handling
is a real-world issue (CWE‑755) where exceptional conditions are improperly suppressed.
