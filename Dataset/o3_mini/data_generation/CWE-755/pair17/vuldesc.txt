The vulnerable code demonstrates an improper handling of exceptional conditions. In the unsafe method that converts a string into a configuration value, any error during parsing is suppressed by using unwrap_or_default(), which returns 0 instead of propagating the error. This design flaw may lead to silent misconfigurations in scenarios where an invalid configuration should trigger a failure.
