The vulnerable code creates an Engine that performs an integer division based on a divisor obtained
by parsing a string input. Instead of handling the potential parsing error properly, it uses
unwrap_or_default(), which silently converts any parse failure into 0. This leads to a division by
zero in the unsafe block, causing a runtime panic. Additionally, concurrent execution via threads
amplifies the unpredictability of error propagation.
