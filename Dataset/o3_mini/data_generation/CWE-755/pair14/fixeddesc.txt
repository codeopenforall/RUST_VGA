The fixed version replaces unwrap_or_default() with proper error propagation. The operate()
method uses map_err() to capture any parsing errors and returns an explicit error message.
Additionally, it checks for a zero divisor and returns an error instead of performing a division.
This change ensures that exceptional conditions are handled correctly rather than being silently
ignored. The overall control flow remains similar and concurrent behavior is preserved, but now
the underlying issues are eliminated.
