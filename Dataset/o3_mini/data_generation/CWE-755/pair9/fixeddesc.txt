In the corrected version, errors during configuration loading are properly handled and propagated. Instead of using unwrap_or_default(), parse errors are not ignored: the parsing of the configuration string returns a Result, and any error is bubbled up. The main thread (and spawned thread) explicitly panic when configuration loading fails, ensuring that misconfiguration does not lead to insecure operation. This change ensures that exceptional conditions are not silently swallowed.
