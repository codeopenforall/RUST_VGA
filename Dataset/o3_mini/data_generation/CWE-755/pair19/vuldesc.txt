This code loads a configuration value from the environment variable "CONFIG_VAL" but uses unwrap_or_default() to silently fallback to an empty string, which when parsed gives 0. Consequently, the unsafe division in compute() (performed via pointer dereferencing) will lead to a division-by-zero panic if the environment variable is missing or invalid. This improper handling of exceptional conditions masks the real error and results in a runtime crash.
