The corrected code refactors the process method to return a Result type rather than an i32.
This change allows the function to propagate errors instead of silently converting them into a default value.
Negative inputs now result in an Err variant, which can be handled explicitly by the caller.
The unsafe block and concurrent design remain to mimic realistic system-level operations while resolving the CWE-755 vulnerability.
