In this implementation, errors from file reading and parsing are suppressed by the use of unwrap_or_default(), 
which converts a missing or malformed file input into an empty string and then a default value (0). 
This improper handling of exceptional conditions hides failures, potentially leading to undetected logic errors 
when concurrent, unsafe pointer operations are performed.
