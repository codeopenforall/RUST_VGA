This code suffers from CWE-755 due to improper handling of exceptional conditions: when parsing the input string into a number,
it uses unwrap_or_default(), which silently converts any parsing error into a default value of 0. As a result, invalid inputs
(e.g. "invalid") do not produce an error and are instead processed as 0, leading to unintended behavior in subsequent logic.
Additionally, the code uses unsafe blocks and concurrent threads to mimic real-world patterns, exacerbating potential risks.
