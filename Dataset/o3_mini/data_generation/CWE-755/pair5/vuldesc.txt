The above vulnerable code demonstrates improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755). Should the load_config function fail (for example, when the "TRIGGER" environment variable is absent), an error is returned; however, the Processor::new constructor swallows this error with unwrap_or_default, silently substituting a default configuration (with factor == 0). This may lead to incorrect computations and inconsistent behavior, as the error (failed configuration load) is improperly hidden.
