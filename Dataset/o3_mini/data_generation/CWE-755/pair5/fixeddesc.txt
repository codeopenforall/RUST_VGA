The fixed code applies proper error handling: Processor::new now returns a Result and propagates errors from load_config rather than silently substituting a default configuration. As a result, when the configuration fails to load (i.e. when the "TRIGGER" environment variable is not set), the error is correctly propagated and the application exits with a failure code. This ensures that exceptional conditions are not hidden, thereby aligning with secure coding best practices.
