The corrected version addresses the unchecked return value vulnerability by modifying the update method to refrain from updating
the shared value if doing so would exceed the allowed range. Additionally, the caller now examines the result of the update call,
allowing the program to skip any changes that would lead to an insecure state. As a result, the final value remains within the safe range
(100 in this example), ensuring that the vulnerability is remediated.
