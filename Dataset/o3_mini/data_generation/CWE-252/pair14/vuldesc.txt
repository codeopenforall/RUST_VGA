The vulnerable code contains a flaw where the result of an unsafe operation (unsafe_op) is unchecked.
In the run() method, the return value of unsafe_op is ignored (using “let _ = …”), so even when the operation fails (for input equal to 42),
the thread proceeds to update the shared flag to true.
This behavior can lead to an inconsistent program state, as the failure is silently dismissed.
This pattern characterizes CWE-252 (Unchecked Return Value) by continuing operations despite an error being returned.
