This version exhibits a classic CWE-252 vulnerability by failing to check the return value from a function
that might signal an error (here, a buffer overflow) during an unsafe memory operation. Specifically,
the error produced by the unsafe add_data function is discarded in process(), allowing invalid data
to potentially corrupt memory in concurrent execution.
