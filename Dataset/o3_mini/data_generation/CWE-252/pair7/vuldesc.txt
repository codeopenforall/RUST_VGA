This version exhibits an Unchecked Return Value vulnerability (CWE-252). In both its synchronous and concurrent update routines, the function that performs an unsafe memory write returns a Result indicating whether the index was valid. However, the error cases are explicitly ignored (using “let _ = …” and not joining the thread to check its outcome), which means out‐of‐bound indices (e.g. 15 or 20 in a 10-element vector) are attempted regardless. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security breaches.
