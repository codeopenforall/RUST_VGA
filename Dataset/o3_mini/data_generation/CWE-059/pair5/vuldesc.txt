This code demonstrates a vulnerability where the program writes sensitive data concurrently to a file specified by a user‐controlled path without validating if the file is a symbolic link. The unsafe block mimics low-level file operations by converting the file path into a raw pointer, but more importantly, no check is performed to ensure that the target file is not a symlink. Attackers may exploit this flaw by creating a symbolic link that points to a sensitive file, thus allowing unintended file modifications.
