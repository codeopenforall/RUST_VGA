In this version, the file access function blindly follows the supplied file path—even after performing an unsafe conversion on the path string—and does not verify whether the resolved path remains within an allowed base directory. As a result, an attacker can supply a filename containing directory traversal sequences (such as "../") or even malicious symbolic links to access files outside the intended folder. This behavior is characteristic of CWE-059.
