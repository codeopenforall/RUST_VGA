In this implementation the function that resolves file names unsafely concatenates a base directory string with user‐supplied input using an unsafe block and unchecked memory operations. This leads to an improper path resolution vulnerability (CWE-059) since directory traversal sequences (e.g. "../") are not properly validated. As a result, an attacker can manipulate the resolved path to access sensitive files.
