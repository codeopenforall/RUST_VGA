This code demonstrates a vulnerability in which symbolic link resolution is handled improperly. An unsafe block converts a path to a C string and then back to a Rust string without revalidating the file path. This introduces a race condition where an attacker can modify a symlink between the metadata check and file opening, potentially allowing access to unintended files (CWE-059).
