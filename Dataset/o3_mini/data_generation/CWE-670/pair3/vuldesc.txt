The vulnerable code contains a flawed control flow inside the evaluate function. Using an unsafe block for pointer manipulation,
the match statement is mistaken: when the username is "guest", the branch incorrectly sets the access flag to true instead of false.
This defect, stemming from an always-incorrect branch, undermines the intended security check and permits unauthorized operations.
