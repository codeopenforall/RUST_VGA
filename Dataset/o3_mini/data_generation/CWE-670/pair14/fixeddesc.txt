In this corrected version the token verification function has been fixed so that it now only authorizes requests
with the "admin" token. The match expression now returns true for "admin" and false for all other tokens,
thus restoring the intended control flow. This ensures that the critical unsafe operation, which produces 1337,
is executed only under the proper security condition while maintaining the concurrent design.
