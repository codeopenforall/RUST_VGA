The vulnerability lies in the flawed control flow inside the token verification function.
The intended logic should authorize the "admin" token; however, due to an inversion in the match arms,
the code returns false for "admin" and true for all other tokens. This misdirected logic causes the secure,
unsafe operation to be bypassed when it should be executed, and vice versa, potentially leading to erroneous
or insecure behavior in a concurrent setting.
