This code erroneously trusts the incoming header by unsafely reconstructing it with an unchecked conversion and then applying flawed logic that unconditionally returns a positive validation result. Because the validation logic overlooks a proper comparison against the expected origin, any provided header – including malicious values – is accepted. This mirrors real-world vulnerabilities (CWE-346) where reliance on unverified headers opens the door to CSRF or SSRF attacks.
