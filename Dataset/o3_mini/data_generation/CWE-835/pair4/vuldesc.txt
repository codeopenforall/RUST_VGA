The vulnerable code unsafely converts a Rust String into a C string via CStr::from_ptr, assuming that the string is null-terminated. Attackers can exploit this by inserting an embedded null byte (\"\\0\") in the header value. This causes the conversion to ignore any data after the null byte, potentially bypassing the intended origin check and enabling attacks such as CSRF or SSRF.
