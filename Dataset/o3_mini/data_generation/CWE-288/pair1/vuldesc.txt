This code simulates a real-world vulnerability (CWE-288) where an alternate debug
authentication path is left enabled in production. The function "verify" incorrectly
bypasses normal authentication when processing requests to the "/debug" endpoint.
An unsafe block is used to dereference a pointer to a misconfigured flag ("debug_bypass")
causing the function to return a successful authentication regardless of a missing token.
Concurrent execution and pointer manipulation mimic complex real-world scenarios.
