This code implements an authentication check in a concurrent context but mistakenly allows an alternate authentication path via a debug header.
If the request contains the header "X-Debug-Bypass" with the value "true", an unsafe block is used to unconditionally grant access.
This bypass of the normal password check represents an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-288), as it allows unauthorized users to gain access.
