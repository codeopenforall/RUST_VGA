The revised code removes the unsafe alternate authentication route.
It introduces a debug flag that, when false (as it should be in production), forces the system
to ignore any debug bypass header. This ensures that the authentication check depends solely
on verifying the correct password ("secure-password"), thereby closing the authentication bypass vulnerability.
