The above code is vulnerable because it uses an unsafe global variable (DEBUG_FLAG)
to control a debug mode that completely bypasses proper token authentication.
When the debug flag is set to true (as it is in the main method), the authenticate
function returns true regardless of the provided token. This behavior is exploited to
obtain administrative access even with invalid credentials, effectively bypassing the
intended authentication mechanism. The concurrency and use of Arc/Mutex mimic real-world
server patterns, while the unsafe block exposes a real risk when combined with mutable
shared state.
