This version derives the PATH environment variable value directly from an untrusted source ("CUSTOM_PATH"). An attacker can control this variable, causing the program to use a malicious search path when locating executables. The use of an unsafe block to manipulate a pointer to the string further illustrates a low-level coding pattern that mirrors real-world cases where unsafe constructs obscure the oversight of security-critical data. The vulnerability lies in accepting and using attacker-controlled environment input to influence the search path used by Command::new.
