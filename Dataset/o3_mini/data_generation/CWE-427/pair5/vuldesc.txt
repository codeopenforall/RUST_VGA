This code suffers from CWE-427 by using an environment variable (INJECTED_PATH) controlled by an external actor to set the PATH for an external command call. The unsafe block uses raw pointer manipulation without validating that the string is a valid, null‐terminated C string. Combined with concurrency through threads and unsafe pointer conversion, this mimics a realistic vulnerability reported in RustSec/CVE listings.
