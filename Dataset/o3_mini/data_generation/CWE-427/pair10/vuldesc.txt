This vulnerable code exhibits CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element.
It accepts an attacker-controlled environment variable ("UNTRUSTED_PATH") without validation
and uses it to set the PATH for a spawned process. Additionally, it unsafely converts the string
to a C-style string using an unsafe block, risking undefined behavior if the data is not null-terminated.
These patterns mimic real-world mistakes where user input influences dynamic library search paths.
