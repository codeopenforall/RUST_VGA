This version processes a buffer of bytes by computing their sum. Inside the calculation function, an unsafe block is used to iterate over the buffer by pointer arithmetic. However, the loop uses an inclusive range (0..=len) rather than the exclusive (0..len). This off-by-one mistake causes the function to read one element beyond the valid memory of the vector, potentially leading to undefined behavior. Concurrency via threads and smart pointer sharing (Arc) simulates a realistic multithreading context similar to vulnerabilities documented in RustSec.
