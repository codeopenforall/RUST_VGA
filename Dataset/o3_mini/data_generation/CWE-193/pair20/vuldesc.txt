This code exhibits a classic off-by-one error in its unsafe block within the load_data function.
During the copy loop, it incorrectly reads src[i+1] for every iteration.
When i reaches the last valid index (src.len() - 1), src[i+1] accesses memory beyond the allocated slice,
resulting in undefined behavior, potential memory corruption, or panics. The issue is masked by the manual
set_len call and improper loop indexing.
