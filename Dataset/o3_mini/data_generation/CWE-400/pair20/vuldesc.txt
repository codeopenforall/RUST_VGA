This code continuously accepts and stores new “connections” in an unbounded vector by employing unsafe pointer conversions within a tight loop—without any delay or backpressure. The intended limit parameter is ignored, allowing the vector to grow without bounds and consuming unlimited CPU and memory resources. This uncontrolled resource consumption could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
