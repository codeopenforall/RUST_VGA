This revised version introduces proper backpressure by capping the stored connections to a configurable limit. Instead of using unsafe pointer manipulation, it safely appends new connections only if the current count is below the threshold. A brief delay in each loop iteration prevents CPU saturation. These improvements effectively mitigate uncontrolled resource consumption, defending against denial-of-service scenarios.
