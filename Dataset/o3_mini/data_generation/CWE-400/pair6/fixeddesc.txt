In the fixed version, the vulnerability is addressed by switching from an unbounded channel (mpsc::channel) to a bounded synchronous channel (mpsc::sync_channel) with a capacity defined by LIMIT. Producer threads now check the current load and block (via a loop with sleep) when the load nears the set limit rather than panicking. This backpressure mechanism prevents unbounded memory and CPU consumption, effectively mitigating the uncontrolled resource consumption (DoS) vulnerability while still demonstrating the use of unsafe code for low-level operations.
