This version demonstrates uncontrolled resource consumption. It spawns one thread per job request and allocates 10 MB in each without any form of validation or backpressure. An unsafe block is used to set the length of the allocated vector without proper bounds checking, and there is no limit imposed on the number of jobs that can be scheduled. A large input will cause excessive memory allocation and thread creation, leading to potential denial-of-service.
