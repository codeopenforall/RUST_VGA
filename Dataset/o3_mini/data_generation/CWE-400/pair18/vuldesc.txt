The vulnerable code defines a shared pool using an UnsafeCell<Vec<i32>> and
implements concurrent insertion via multiple threads without any synchronization.
The unsynchronized push in the unsafe block (lines 20–21) permits unbounded growth
of the vector, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption (DoS). This mirrors real-world
issues where unsafe concurrency primitives are abused, and no resource limits are imposed.
