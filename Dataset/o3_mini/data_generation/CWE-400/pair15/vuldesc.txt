The vulnerable implementation spawns a new thread for each incoming task without any backpressure, using an unbounded loop over the provided count. It employs unsafe code to perform low-level memory initialization on a vector and then pushes it into a shared container. Without any limit enforced on the number of tasks, an attacker might specify an extremely high count, causing unbounded CPU and memory consumption, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) according to CWE-400.
