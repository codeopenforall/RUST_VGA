This code demonstrates a real‐world vulnerability where uncontrolled resource consumption is possible. It uses a globally shared mutable raw pointer (GLOBAL_QUEUE) that is accessed unsafely and concurrently from multiple threads. There is no synchronization or backpressure applied when appending data, allowing an attacker (or heavy load) to exhaust system resources (DoS). The unsafe usage with concurrent unsynchronized writes to a vector reflects patterns seen in past RustSec and CVE reports.
