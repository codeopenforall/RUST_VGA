The fixed version introduces a limit (MAX_QUEUE) on the number of tasks allowed in the global vector. In the enqueue function, a check ensures that tasks are only accepted if the current size is below the predefined limit. This backpressure mechanism stops unbounded accumulation and prevents potential denial-of-service due to excessive memory usage. The unsafe blocks remain, but now with proper resource checks based on community best practices.
