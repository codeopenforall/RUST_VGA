This code suffers from an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. In the function run_service, a vector is allocated with a capacity only half the size of the intended number of tasks. An unsafe block is then used to perform unchecked pointer arithmetic and to manually increase the vector’s length, bypassing Rust’s bounds checking. In addition, for each item a new thread is spawned without any backpressure mechanisms, which – for large inputs – may exhaust system resources. This pattern emulates real-world issues seen in some RustSec advisories where unsafe memory handling and uncontrolled concurrency lead to DoS.
