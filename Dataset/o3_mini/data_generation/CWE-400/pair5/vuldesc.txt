The vulnerability arises from an uncontrolled resource consumption issue where tasks are added to an unbounded vector inside an unsafe block without any capacity checks or backpressure mechanisms. An attacker (or defective design) can flood the system with tasks leading to excessive memory usage (CWE-400). The use of UnsafeCell bypasses Rust’s guarantees and allows concurrent threads to grow the vector without synchronization, further exacerbating the problem.
