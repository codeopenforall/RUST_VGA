The fixed code mitigates the uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability by enforcing an upper limit on the number of threads spawned. The constant MAX_THREADS (set to 1000) serves as a cap. When the user input exceeds this limit, only MAX_THREADS threads are launched, preventing the creation of an excessive number of threads. This effectively reduces the risk of DoS while still maintaining the original concurrency pattern.
