This vulnerable implementation suffers from uncontrolled resource consumption. It continuously spawns threads that insert tasks into a shared Vec with no backpressure or upper limit. An unsafe block is used to perform unchecked pointer arithmetic to modify the vector, mimicking a real-world unsafe Rust situation. The provided limit parameter is ignored; hence, if many iterations are specified, memory consumption may spiral, potentially leading to a denial of service.
