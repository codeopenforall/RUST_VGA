The corrected version introduces a maximum task limit and checks this limit in the processing routine. The unsafe block is now guarded by a conditional check to avoid unnecessary and unsafe memory modifications. This backpressure mechanism prevents the vector from growing beyond the designated threshold, mitigating uncontrolled resource consumption and thus avoiding potential DoS conditions.
