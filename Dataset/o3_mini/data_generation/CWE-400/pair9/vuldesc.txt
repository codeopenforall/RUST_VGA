The code above is vulnerable because it uses an unsafe block with raw pointer arithmetic to iterate over an input vector. If the input data exceeds 100 elements, it arbitrarily limits processing to the first 100 elements rather than processing all items. Such an invariant (hard-capping the processed elements) can be exploited to trigger denial-of-service (CWE-400) when attackers supply oversized inputs, causing resource mismanagement and incorrect results.
