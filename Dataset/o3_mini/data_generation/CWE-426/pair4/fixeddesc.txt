In this version, the vulnerability is corrected by ensuring that the executable path returned by entry_path is absolute ("/usr/local/bin/my_plugin"). This change prevents an attacker from exploiting an untrusted search path by inserting a malicious executable earlier in the search order. The rest of the code, including the use of unsafe blocks, smart pointers, and concurrency, remains similar to simulate a real-world, non-trivial application.
