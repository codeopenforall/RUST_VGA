This version demonstrates a vulnerability where an executable or library is loaded using a relative path ("danger_exec"). By not specifying an absolute path, the code is susceptible to CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path), which can lead to DLL or executable preloading attacks. Additionally, the unsafe block used to convert a CString to a &str mimics risky FFI usage often seen in real-world code.
