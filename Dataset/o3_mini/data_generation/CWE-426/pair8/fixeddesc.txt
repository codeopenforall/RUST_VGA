This corrected version mitigates the CWE-426 vulnerability by ensuring that an absolute path is used when launching the external executable. The Loader struct now stores the command as a PathBuf with an absolute path (e.g., "/usr/bin/fixed_cmd_exe"), and the run() method explicitly checks that the path is absolute before launching the command. Unsafe raw pointer manipulations have been retained for demonstration only; however, no security-critical decisions rely on them. This adjustment prevents an attacker from preloading a malicious executable by manipulating the search path.
