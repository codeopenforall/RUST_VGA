In this corrected version the vulnerability is mitigated by requiring that the external 
command be specified with an absolute path. The code checks whether the provided path is 
absolute (using std::path::Path) and refuses to run if it is not, returning an error. This 
ensures that the executable being called is the expected binary, rather than one that might 
be substituted by an attacker through manipulation of the system search path.
