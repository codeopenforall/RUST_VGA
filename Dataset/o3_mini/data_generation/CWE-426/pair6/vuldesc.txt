The code above is vulnerable because it constructs a command using a relative binary name ("malicious_cmd") without an absolute path. Consequently, an attacker who can influence the search path might substitute a malicious executable. The unsafe block encapsulating the command execution, along with thread concurrency via std::thread, adds complexity and risk, making this a realistic example of CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path).
