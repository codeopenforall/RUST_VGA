In this corrected version, the constructor of the application (App::new) computes an absolute path for the external binary by joining the current working directory with the filename ("plugin.so"). By doing so, the code mitigates the untrusted search path issue (CWE-426). The unsafe block that converts the command string into a C-style string remains, but now the invariant is enforced: the command string begins with an absolute path indicator (typically '/' on Unix-like systems), ensuring that the correct and trusted binary is executed.
