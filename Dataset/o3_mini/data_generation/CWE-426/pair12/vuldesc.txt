The code uses a relative path ("helper_program") to invoke an external executable and employs an unsafe block for C string manipulation. This combination exposes the application to CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path. An attacker could insert a malicious executable with the same relative name in a directory that is searched earlier, leading to arbitrary code execution.
