This code demonstrates a vulnerability where an external executable is launched using a relative path (e.g. "my_exe") without proper resolution to an absolute path. The use of an unsafe block around the Command invocation, combined with concurrent execution via threads, mimics real-world patterns where an adversary could exploit the untrusted search path (CWE-426) by placing a malicious executable earlier in the search order.
