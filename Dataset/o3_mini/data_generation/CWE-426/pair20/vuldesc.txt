The code above is vulnerable to CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) because it uses a relative path ("dummy_executable")
to load an external executable. An attacker could exploit this by placing a malicious executable in the search path,
leading to "DLL preloading" or execution of untrusted code. The vulnerability is introduced by not using an absolute path when invoking the external program.
