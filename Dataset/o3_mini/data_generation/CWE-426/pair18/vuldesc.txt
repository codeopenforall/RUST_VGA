This vulnerable code uses an unsafe conversion to create a CString from a relative executable name ("echo") and then calls Command::new inside an unsafe block. Because the command path is relative (and not absolute), if an attacker controls the PATH environment variable, a malicious executable with the same name could be run. This pattern reflects real-world issues reported under CWE-426 for untrusted search path vulnerabilities.
