This vulnerable implementation exposes CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) by dynamically selecting an executable using a relative path without enforcing an absolute, secure path. If the environment variable "USE_MALICIOUS" is set to "1", the function chooses "malicious_helper", which an attacker could place in a directory that appears earlier in the PATH. Additionally, the code employs an unsafe block for process creation combined with concurrency, mimicking real-world flaws reported in RustSec advisories.
