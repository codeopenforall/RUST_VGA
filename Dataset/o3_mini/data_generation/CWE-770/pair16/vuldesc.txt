This vulnerable code demonstrates unbounded resource allocation as described by CWE-770. The function responsible for memory allocation calculates the allocation size by simply multiplying the input parameter by 1,000,000 without any upper limit checks. The unsafe block performing the direct memory allocation does not verify that the requested allocation is within reasonable bounds. As a result, a malicious input (e.g., 150 or higher) can lead to resource exhaustion, mimicking real-world vulnerabilities observed in RustSec reports.
