The above code demonstrates a resource exhaustion vulnerability (CWE-770) combined with unsafe memory operations. It allocates a vector based solely on user-supplied input without any limits. When the input exceeds a predefined threshold (LIMIT), an unsafe block is used to write past the valid bounds of the vector. This unbounded allocation and out-of-bound write can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or exploitable behavior in real-world applications.
