This code spawns a number of threads based solely on user input and uses an unsafe block for pointer arithmetic without capping the array index range. If the input count exceeds the size of a local array (10), the offset leads to an out‐of-bounds pointer dereference. This vulnerability (CWE-770) demonstrates uncontrolled allocation and unsafe memory access without proper validation.
