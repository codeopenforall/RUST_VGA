The vulnerable code demonstrates a common resource exhaustion vulnerability (CWE-770) by spawning an unbounded number of threads. Each thread performs an unsafe allocation for a fixed-size buffer without verifying or constraining the input. This lack of throttling may lead to uncontrolled resource consumption, which can exhaust system resources and lead to Denial of Service conditions.
