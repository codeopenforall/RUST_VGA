The code above exhibits a resource allocation vulnerability (CWE-770) by using an unchecked user input value to determine both the amount of memory allocated (via an unsafe raw allocation transformed into a Vec) and the number of concurrently spawned threads. There is no throttling mechanism in place, making it susceptible to exhaustion of system resources when provided with extreme input values.
