This code spawns threads without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent threads or the size of memory allocations. Each spawned thread uses an unsafe block to create and manipulate a large vector before storing it in shared memory. The absence of resource throttling may lead to unbounded memory and thread allocation (CWE-770), potentially causing the system to run out of resources.
