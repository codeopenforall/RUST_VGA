This code implements a recursive descent parser which processes an input string containing nested parentheses. The recursive function (parse_expr) uses an unsafe block to bypass bounds checking when reading the input, and it never enforces a limit on the depth of recursion. When fed with an attacker-crafted input containing too many nested parentheses, this uncontrolled recursion can lead to a stack overflow (CWE-674).
