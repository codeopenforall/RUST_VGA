This vulnerable code suffers from uncontrolled recursion because the recursive parsing function (parse_recursively) does not enforce any maximum recursion depth. An attacker can provide extremely deeply nested input (ex: thousands of nested parentheses) and trigger a stack overflow, causing the program to crash. The use of unsafe code to dereference a raw pointer exacerbates the issue by removing array bounds checking.
