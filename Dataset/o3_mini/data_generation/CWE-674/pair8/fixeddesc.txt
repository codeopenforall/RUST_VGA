In this corrected version, a maximum recursion depth (MAX_DEPTH) is introduced into the recursive descent
parsing. Each recursive invocation of parse_expr() carries an additional depth counter. If the depth 
exceeds MAX_DEPTH, the function returns an error rather than continuing the recursion. This effectively 
prevents an attacker from triggering a stack overflow by providing deeply nested input. All original unsafe 
operations and parsing logic are preserved to maintain realistic system behavior.
