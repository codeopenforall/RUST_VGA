In this corrected version the recursive accumulation function now accepts a depth parameter and enforces an upper limit (MAX_RECURSION). If the recursion surpasses this limit, an error is returned instead of continuing indefinitely. This fix prevents the stack overflow vulnerability associated with overly deep or malicious input, while retaining the overall design and concurrent processing structure.
