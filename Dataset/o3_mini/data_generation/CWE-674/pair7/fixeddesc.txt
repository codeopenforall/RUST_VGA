In this corrected version the recursive descent parser has been modified to accept and propagate a recursion depth parameter. Before each recursive call the current depth is checked against a defined maximum (MAX_DEPTH). If the recursion depth exceeds this threshold, the function aborts with an error instead of recursing further, thereby mitigating the stack overflow vulnerability. Additionally, the unsafe block is removed from node construction to use safe Rust conventions.
