This code exhibits a race condition vulnerability (CWE-362) by unsafely checking and initializing a global shared resource without proper synchronization. Two concurrent threads call "acquire_resource", and due to an intentional delay between the null-check and initialization, both threads may end up allocating separate instances. This introduces a time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition that violates the singleton invariant.
