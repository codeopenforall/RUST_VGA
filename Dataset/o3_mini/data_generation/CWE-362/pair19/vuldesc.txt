This vulnerable code suffers from a race condition (CWE-362) because it uses an unsynchronized read-modify-write 
on a globally shared counter via a raw pointer inside unsafe blocks. Multiple threads concurrently read, update, 
and write the counter value without any locking or atomic guarantees, causing data races and inconsistent state 
(e.g. the final counter might be less than 10000).
