This vulnerable code simulates an authentication system that suffers from CWE-287: Improper Authentication. 
The vulnerability arises from the misuse of an unsafe block and raw pointer comparisons within a concurrent thread. 
Instead of doing a proper string equality check, the code compares the memory addresses of the provided token 
and the stored secret, a flawed approach that results in the method always returning success, thereby allowing an 
attacker to bypass authentication.
