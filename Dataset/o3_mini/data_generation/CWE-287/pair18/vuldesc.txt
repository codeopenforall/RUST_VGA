Description: This implementation contains an authentication flaw where the unsafe comparison routine only verifies the first character of the credential against the secret. By using unchecked memory accesses in unsafe blocks and performing the check concurrently, any credential that begins with the correct character ('P' in this case) is erroneously accepted. This mistake represents an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-287) observed in real-world RustSec reports.
