In this corrected version the compute method first checks that the payload vector has at least 12 bytes.
If the precondition is not met, it immediately returns None. This ensures that the subsequent unsafe block,
which reinterprets the payload into three u32 values, abides by the API expectations regarding valid pointers and memory layout.
This fix thus prevents undefined behavior from out-of-bound memory accesses.
