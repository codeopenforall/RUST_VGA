The corrected implementation explicitly checks that the input slice is not empty before performing any pointer arithmetic. If the input is empty, it returns 0 immediately rather than attempting to create a subslice with a length computed as (len - 1). This change ensures that all API preconditions are met and prevents the undefined behavior associated with invalid pointer offsets.
