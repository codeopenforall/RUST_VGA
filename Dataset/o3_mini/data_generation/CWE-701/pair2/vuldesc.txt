The vulnerable code creates a raw pointer from a slice by subtracting one from the base pointer, which violates the preconditions for safe pointer arithmetic. This results in undefined behavior when later using the pointer in an unsafe block to create a slice and calculate its sum. Concurrency is simulated by spawning a thread that uses the unsafe pointer, mimicking real-world usage patterns seen in some RustSec/CVE reports.
