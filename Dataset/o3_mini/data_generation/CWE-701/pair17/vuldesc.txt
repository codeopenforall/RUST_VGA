This implementation defines a Container type that wraps a raw pointer and its length,
constructed from a valid slice of 4 u32 elements. However, the aggregate method incorrectly
calls std::slice::from_raw_parts with a length of self.len + 1, thus reading one element beyond
the provided slice. This violates the API precondition, leading to undefined behavior and potential
security issues as it accesses memory not owned by the slice.
