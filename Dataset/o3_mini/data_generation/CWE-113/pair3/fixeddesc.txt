This revised code sanitizes any carriage return and line feed characters from the untrusted
input before incorporating it into the HTTP header. By filtering out '\r' and '\n' using safe
Rust string manipulation, it prevents CRLF injection and thus mitigates the HTTP response splitting
vulnerability. The unsafe block present in the vulnerable implementation has been completely removed.
