The above code directly copies user-provided input (which may include carriage return and line feed characters) into a fixed-size buffer using unsafe pointer operations.
It then constructs an HTTP header without any sanitization, making the header vulnerable to CRLF injection and, subsequently, HTTP response splitting attacks.
An attacker could supply a header value containing CRLF sequences (e.g., "NormalValue\r\nInjected: malicious") to inject additional headers or content.
