This vulnerable implementation builds an HTTP header by directly concatenating a fixed prefix with untrusted input. The untrusted input is not sanitized and may contain CRLF characters, allowing an attacker to inject additional headers or split the HTTP response (CWE-113: HTTP Response Splitting). The use of unsafe code with a globally shared UnsafeCell in a concurrent setting further demonstrates a realistic yet unsafe programming pattern found in the wild.
