This code constructs an HTTP response header by directly interpolating external input without any sanitization. It uses an unsafe block to manipulate raw pointers from a CString, combined with concurrency (Arc and Mutex) to mimic realistic usage patterns. The unsanitized input can include CRLF sequences, allowing an attacker to perform HTTP response splitting (CWE-113) by injecting additional headers.
