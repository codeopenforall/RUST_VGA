The above code is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting (CWE-113) because it takes untrusted input and embeds it into HTTP headers without filtering out CR/LF characters. The unsafe block is used to perform raw pointer manipulation, mimicking real-world patterns where low-level memory operations are employed. If the input contains "\r\n", an attacker can inject additional headers.
