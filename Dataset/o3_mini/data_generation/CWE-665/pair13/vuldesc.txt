This code implements an API with token-based authentication. However, it contains a critical flaw: an unsafe block
checks for the presence of an "X-Debug" header and immediately returns sensitive debug information if present,
thus bypassing all normal authentication. Although a debug key exists in the data structure, it is completely ignored
in the authentication process. This vulnerability enables an attacker to access secret data by simply adding an
"X-Debug" header to their request.
