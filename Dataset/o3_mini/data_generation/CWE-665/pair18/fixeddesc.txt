In this corrected version, the unsafe global variable is removed from the
authentication logic. The debug flag parameter is retained only for API
compatibility and no longer influences authentication. The authenticate method
always verifies whether the provided token exists in the valid tokens list,
ensuring that only clients with correct credentials can access the admin endpoint.
This change prevents any alternate authentication bypass routes.
