In the fixed code, the unsafe alternate authentication path has been removed. Even when debug mode is
active, the verify() function now strictly compares the provided credential with the stored secret.
This adjustment ensures that no alternate or bypass path exists—thus enforcing proper authentication
and mitigating the CWE-288 vulnerability. Additionally, the debug branch now only logs that debug mode
is active without compromising security.
