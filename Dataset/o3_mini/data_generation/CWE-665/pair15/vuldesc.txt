The above code demonstrates an authentication bypass vulnerability. Specifically, when a request is sent to the "/debug" endpoint, the code checks an unsafe global flag (GLOBAL_DEBUG) and, if set, bypasses the standard token authentication. This creates an alternate code path that allows unauthorized access, representing a real-world instance of CWE-288.
