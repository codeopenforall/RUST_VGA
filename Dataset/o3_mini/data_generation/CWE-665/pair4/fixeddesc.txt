In the corrected code the authentication bypass vulnerability is resolved by removing the unsafe global debug flag. The application now reads its operational mode from the runtime environment variable "APP_MODE" and always performs a proper secure check. Concurrent execution is maintained using safe synchronization primitives, ensuring that the authentication flow cannot be bypassed due to debug mode misconfiguration.
