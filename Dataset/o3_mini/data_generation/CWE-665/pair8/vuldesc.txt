This vulnerable code simulates an authentication bypass via an alternate debug endpoint. When the request path is "debug" and the service is in debug mode (indicated by the debug_mode flag), the code enters an unsafe block that reads the flag from a raw pointer. The ensuing logic bypasses the intended authentication check—returning success even when an invalid token is provided. This insecure bypass can be exploited as an alternate authentication path, leading to unauthorized access.
