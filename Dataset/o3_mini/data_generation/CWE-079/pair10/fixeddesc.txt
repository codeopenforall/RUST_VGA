The revised implementation introduces an HTML escaping function that converts characters such as '<', '>', '&', '\"', and '\'' into their corresponding HTML entities. This ensures that malicious input cannot break out of the intended HTML context. In addition, the unsafe memory manipulation block has been removed in favor of using safe Rust string operations, eliminating the unsafe behavior from the template rendering process.
