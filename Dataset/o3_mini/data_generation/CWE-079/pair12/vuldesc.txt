This code reflects untrusted user input directly into an HTML template without sanitization. An unsafe block is used to perform in-place memory writes based on user input without checking if the input fits into the reserved space, which risks buffer corruption. As a result, malicious input like "<script>…</script>" is embedded unescaped in the output, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-079) vulnerability.
