This version improperly renders untrusted input directly into an HTML template without any escaping or sanitization, exposing the application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The unsafe block that calls std::str::from_utf8_unchecked bypasses runtime UTF-8 validation, increasing the risk if invalid inputs are provided. Concurrent access via Arc and Mutex further simulates a realistic application where user input is rendered in a multi-threaded environment.
