This version directly reflects the untrusted user input into the HTML response without any sanitization. The core vulnerability occurs in the render method where an unsafe block unsafely manipulates the internal byte vector of the String and appends the raw input. As a result, if the input contains malicious HTML/JavaScript code (e.g. <script> tags), it will be output unescaped, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-079) vulnerabilities.
