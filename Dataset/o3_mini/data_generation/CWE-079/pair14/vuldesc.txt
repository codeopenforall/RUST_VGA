This code simulates a web template rendering system that accepts untrusted input and uses an unsafe block to read the input via raw pointers. The renderer substitutes a placeholder in an HTML template with the provided user input. Because the input is inserted directly into the HTML without any escaping or sanitization, if a malicious script is provided (e.g., a &lt;script&gt; tag), the output HTML will contain executable JavaScript – a classic cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
