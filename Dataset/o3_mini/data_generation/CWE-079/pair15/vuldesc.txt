This code implements a basic HTML rendering engine that substitutes a placeholder in a template using user-provided input. In the render method, an unsafe block is used to convert the raw bytes of the input into a string without any form of sanitization. As a result, if the input contains malicious JavaScript (e.g. <script> tags), it will be directly injected, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-079). The use of concurrency and shared state via Arc and Mutex mimics realistic multi-threaded scenarios in web servers.
