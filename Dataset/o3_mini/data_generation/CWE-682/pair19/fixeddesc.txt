In the corrected version the conversion function now properly calculates the milliseconds by performing
a direct multiplication ("secs * self.unit") rather than performing a division first. This change prevents
the truncation error observed in the vulnerable version. Moreover, the unsafe block used for raw pointer
manipulation is removed, relying on safe Mutex locking to handle concurrent access, thereby aligning the code
with safe Rust practices.
