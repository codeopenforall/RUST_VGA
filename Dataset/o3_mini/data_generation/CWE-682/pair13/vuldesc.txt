The vulnerable code instantiates a calculation object that holds a percentage value. Its compute method,
// which is executed within an unsafe block for demonstration purposes, erroneously calculates the
// deduction by performing integer division (r/100) before multiplication with the revenue. For a rate
// less than 100, this yields 0 instead of the expected scaled value, leading to an incorrect result.
