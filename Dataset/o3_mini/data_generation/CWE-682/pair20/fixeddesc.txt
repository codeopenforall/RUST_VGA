In the corrected code, the calculation error has been addressed by modifying the compute method. The arithmetic now correctly groups the denominator and the scaling factor as denominator * scale, ensuring that the division is executed as intended (numerator divided by the product of denominator and scale). With the same parameters (scale=10, numerator=100, denominator=5), the function now correctly returns 2. The unsafe code and concurrency logic remain intact to simulate a realistic usage scenario.
