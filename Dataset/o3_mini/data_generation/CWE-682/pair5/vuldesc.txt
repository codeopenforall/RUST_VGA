This version contains a logic error in the arithmetic calculation. The method intended to compute an average divides each integer from the vector by the number of elements (using integer division) before summing them. Because integer division truncates the fractional part, most elements produce zero and the final result is far lower than expected. Additionally, the code uses an unsafe block to perform pointer arithmetic on the vector without extra bounds checking, which in more complex scenarios could lead to undefined behavior.
