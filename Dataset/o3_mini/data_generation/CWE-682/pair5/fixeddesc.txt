In this corrected version, the arithmetic calculation is fixed by summing all the numbers first and then dividing by the count, thus preserving the full precision until the final operation. The unsafe block and raw pointer manipulations have been removed in favor of safe Rust idioms (i.e. using iterators). This ensures that the average is accurately computed (for the given data, 10/4 equals 2 using integer division) and eliminates potential memory safety issues.
