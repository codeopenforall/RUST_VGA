This code simulates an arithmetic vulnerability where the intended percentage gain,
computed by ((input - factor) * 100) / input, is mistakenly implemented as (input - factor) / input * 100.
Due to integer division in Rust, the intermediate division truncates the value before multiplication,
resulting in an incorrect (often zero) result. Additionally, the code uses unsafe pointer dereferencing and concurrency 
to mimic real-world patterns observed in RustSec reports involving unsafe code misuse.
