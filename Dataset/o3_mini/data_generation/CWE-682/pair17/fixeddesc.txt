In this corrected version, the computation in the compute function has been modified to multiply the difference by 100 
before dividing by the input. This adjustment ensures that the intermediate rounding errors due to integer division are avoided,
yielding the intended result. Note that the overall structure—including the use of unsafe, concurrency, and smart pointers—remains the same,
so that the changes are isolated to the arithmetic logic.
