This code suffers from an incorrect calculation due to a misplacement of parentheses in the arithmetic expression within an unsafe block. Instead of computing the intended percentage increase as ((current - base) * 100) / base, it mistakenly evaluates current - (base * 100 / base), which leads to a logically erroneous and exaggerated result. For input values base=200 and current=250, the calculation erroneously yields 150% rather than the correct 25%.
