This vulnerable code uses an unsafe block to dereference a pointer and compute a result concurrently.
The intended calculation was to compute the average (value + factor) / 2. However, due to operator precedence, 
the computation is interpreted as value + (factor / 2), leading to an incorrect result.
Such logic flaws in critical arithmetic operations relate to CWE-682 when they influence security-sensitive decisions.
