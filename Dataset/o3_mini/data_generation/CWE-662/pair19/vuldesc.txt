This code exhibits a CWE-252 vulnerability by ignoring the return value of a function that signals failure. The function “modify” is intended to reject negative inputs by returning an error; however, it still performs an unsafe update even when the input is negative. By discarding the Result, the caller fails to detect that an error occurred, leading to a violation of the invariant that the data must remain non-negative.
