This version fixes the vulnerability by checking the return value from the unsafe initialization method.
Instead of discarding the error, the code uses the “?” operator to propagate errors if the machine is inactive.
This ensures that if the initialization fails, subsequent operations do not proceed, thus properly handling the error condition.
