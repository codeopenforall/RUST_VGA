In this corrected version the unchecked return value is fixed by explicitly checking
the result of each operation. In the thread closure, the return value from executing
the task is matched against Ok and Err. In case of an error, the code panics rather
than ignoring the failure, ensuring that capacity violations or other errors do not go unnoticed.
This adjustment enforces correct behavior and prevents logical inconsistencies that could
occur if an operation failed silently.
