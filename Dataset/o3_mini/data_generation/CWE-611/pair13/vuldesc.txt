This version contains an incorrect check on the result of an unsafe memory copy routine. The low-level "simulated_copy" function returns 0 to indicate success and -1 to indicate failure. However, the "run" method misinterprets the result by treating a nonzero value (in this case, -1) as success, and zero as failure. This inversion of the return value leads to the program erroneously reporting a failure even when the copy operation succeeds, matching the typical manifestation of CWE-253.
