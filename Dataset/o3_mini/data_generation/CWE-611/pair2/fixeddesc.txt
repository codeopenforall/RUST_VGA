In this corrected version, the error from the unsafe operation is properly checked. If the operation returns an Err (as it does for negative inputs), the function immediately returns false to signify failure. This proper interpretation of the function’s return value eliminates the vulnerability, ensuring that erroneous conditions are not misclassified as successes.
