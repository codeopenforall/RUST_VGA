This version contains a vulnerability under CWE-253. The function that performs an unsafe memory copy returns a Result to indicate success or failure. However, in the process method, the error case is misinterpreted: if the unsafe operation returns an error, the function erroneously returns Ok(()) instead of propagating the error. This incorrect check masks underlying failures (such as buffer overflow risks), and adversely affects error detection in concurrent contexts.
