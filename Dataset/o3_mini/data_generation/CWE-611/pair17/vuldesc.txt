This implementation is vulnerable (CWE-253) because it misinterprets the function return values.
In the worker initialization, a negative input sets the worker’s size to zero, which results in a call to Worker::new(0) returning an Err.
However, the code immediately calls unwrap() on the result without verifying its success, causing a panic instead of handling the error gracefully.
Furthermore, within the thread, the update method’s error is incorrectly “handled” by invoking unwrap() in the error branch.
These mistakes in checking the return values lead to unintentional acceptance of error conditions as successful, ultimately compromising the program's robustness.
