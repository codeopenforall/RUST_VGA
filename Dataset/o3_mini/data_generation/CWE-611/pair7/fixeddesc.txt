The revised code fixes the vulnerability by directly propagating the error from the calculation function instead of converting an error into a successful outcome. The processing function now simply returns the result from the calculator without attempting to override error conditions. This ensures that a division-by-zero error is properly detected and reported, preserving the integrity of error handling.
