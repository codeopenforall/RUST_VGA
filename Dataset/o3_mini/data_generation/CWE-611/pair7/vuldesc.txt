This code demonstrates an incorrect check of a function’s return value. The function that performs a calculation (which includes an unsafe block to simulate low‐level operations) returns an error for an invalid input (zero). However, the processing function misinterprets the error condition by using unwrap_or(0) on an Err result, converting the error into a successful result (Ok(0)). This flaw can mask underlying errors and lead to unsafe behavior downstream.
