The above vulnerable code suffers from an incorrect check of the return value from an unsafe external function call. The unsafe function (external_call) returns 0 to signal success and -1 for an error condition. However, the code erroneously treats a return of -1 as success while considering 0 as a failure. This inverted logic can lead to severe misinterpretations of the operation's outcome, potentially triggering downstream logic errors in a concurrent setting.
