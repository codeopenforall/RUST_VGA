The corrected code removes all unsafe constructs and instead uses safe string slicing to extract the header field and body. It avoids improper assumptions about memory layout by no longer using CStr::from_ptr and raw pointer arithmetic. The header extraction trims whitespace and correctly parses the Content-Length value, while the body is extracted based on the "\n\n" delimiter. Concurrent processing is performed in a safe manner by cloning the data, ensuring that both the header and body are interpreted consistently.
