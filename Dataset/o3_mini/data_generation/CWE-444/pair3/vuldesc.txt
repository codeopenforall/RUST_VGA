This code simulates an HTTP server with a vulnerable request parser. It uses an unsafe block to bypass UTF-8 checks and manually copies the request body using pointer arithmetic. An off-by-one error is deliberately introduced in the unsafe block where the body length is set to body_len - 1. This error can lead to mismatches in the reported body length, enabling inconsistent interpretation of HTTP request boundaries that may be exploited in request smuggling scenarios.
