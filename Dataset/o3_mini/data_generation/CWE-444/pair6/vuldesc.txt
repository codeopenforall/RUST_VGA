The above code demonstrates a vulnerability in the HTTP request parser where an unsafe block is used to parse header lines. Specifically, it uses raw pointer arithmetic and unchecked conversion to extract header keys and values. When duplicate "Content-Length" headers are present—with conflicting values—the HashMap overwrites the first value with the second. This inconsistency can lead to a misinterpretation of the request body size (i.e. reading only a subset of the body), thereby enabling request smuggling attacks.
