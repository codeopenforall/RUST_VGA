This version contains a vulnerability related to inconsistent interpretation of HTTP headers typical of request smuggling (CWE-444). It uses an unsafe block to reconstruct the input string via raw pointer arithmetic and unchecked UTF-8 conversion. In doing so, it fails to detect and reject requests that include duplicate headers (for example, multiple Content-Length headers), which can lead to ambiguous behavior between proxy and backend components.
