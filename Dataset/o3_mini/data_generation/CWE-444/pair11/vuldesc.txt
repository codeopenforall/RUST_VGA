This code demonstrates an unsafe HTTP request parser that uses raw pointer arithmetic to locate header/body boundaries and parse header content without proper validation. In the case of ambiguous inputs (e.g. when both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers are present), it improperly relies on Content-Length and may miscalculate the request body’s boundaries. This can lead to request smuggling, where a maliciously crafted payload (“GET /admin …”) is interpreted as part of the body instead of being rejected.
