In the revised version the vulnerability is mitigated by modifying the Debug implementation for the configuration structure. Instead of revealing the actual secret, it now outputs a placeholder "[REDACTED]". Additionally, the error logging uses the same redacted output so that even when an error is encountered, the sensitive information is not exposed. This change adheres to secure coding practices and resolves the CWE-200 issue.
