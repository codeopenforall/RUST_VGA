The code above contains a vulnerability related to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information. In particular, the Debug implementation for the configuration structure prints the actual secret value ("super-secret-1234") in its output. Additionally, during an error condition inside an unsafe block in a concurrent thread, the debug representation is used in an error log that exposes the secret. This mimics real-world issues where sensitive contents leak through error messages or logs.
