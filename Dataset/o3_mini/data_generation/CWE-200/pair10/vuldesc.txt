This version inadvertently exposes a sensitive secret in its logs.
It uses an unsafe block to manipulate a raw pointer into the secret string and then includes that string in the error message,
and the Debug implementation for the credentials also prints the secret in clear text.
This pattern could lead to sensitive information being disclosed in production environments.
