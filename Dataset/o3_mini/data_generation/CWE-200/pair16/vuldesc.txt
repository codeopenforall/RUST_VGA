This code simulates a scenario where sensitive information (an API key) is embedded in an error message. It uses unsafe code for pointer dereferencing and spawns a thread to process data. In case of failure, the error message is constructed with the raw API key, effectively leaking the secret. This behavior is a realistic example of CWE-200, where sensitive data may be inadvertently exposed through error messages or logs.
