This implementation exposes sensitive information by including the confidential API key ("SECRET123") in the Debug output. The unsafe block along with concurrent logging inadvertently reconstructs and prints the entire configuration, including its secret field, without any sanitization. The vulnerability lies in CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information) where sensitive data is leaked through debug logging.
