# RUST-VGA: Benchmark Dataset for Rust Vulnerability Detection
This repository contains the dataset used in the paper **"RUST-VGA: Leverage LLMs to Generate a Benchmark Dataset for Rust**".

RUST-VGA is a large-scale, executable benchmark for **binary vulnerability detection in Rust**, built to support training and evaluation of ML/LLM-based detectors.

- **8,480 executable Rust programs**
- **53 CWE categories**
- Paired **vulnerable** and **fixed** variants
- Each sample includes **tests** used for validation

## What’s in this repository

This repo contains:
- The full RUST-VGA dataset (generated + augmented)
- Generation and augmentation code
- Validation scripts (compile + test; optional ASan checks)

---

## Dataset overview

Each sample is a Rust mini-project with:
- `vulnerable.rs` and `fixed.rs` (paired variants)
- `demo_test.rs` (test that should **fail** on vulnerable and **pass** on fixed)


## Pipeline summary (from the paper)

RUST-VGA is produced in two stages:

1) **Data Generation**
- LLM generates a vulnerable/fixed pair + a test
- We keep a pair only if:
  - both versions compile
  - test fails on vulnerable and passes on fixed

2) **Data Augmentation**
We generate additional variants using three strategies:
- **A1**: test-driven bug injection and repair
- **A2**: vulnerability-specific paraphrasing (structure changes, bug preserved)
- **A3**: contextual completion using diff-based context

### Requirements
- Rust toolchain (recommended: `rustc 1.89.0` or newer)
- Python 3.x

### Validate one sample (compile + test)
Example (replace with your actual script/paths):
```bash
cd Dataset/o3_mini/data_generation/CWE-190/pair1
cargo test
```
